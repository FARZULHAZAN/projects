Specifically, the allowed values of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_%28physics%29#Spin_quantum_number\" rel=\"noreferrer\">spin quantum number</a> $s$ are non-negative multiples of 1/2.

       "  'Body': '<p>In general usage, \"sound\" refers to our perception of the vibrations of particles (atoms, molecules) in some medium, typically air or water, though sound waves can travel through any medium.  </p>\\n\\n<p>Vibrations are produced whenever objects cause the particles in the medium to oscillate, e.g. clapping your hands together, beating a drum, or yelling.  </p>\\n\\n<p>Sound can be measured the way it is heard - just as air molecules begin to vibrate in the presence of a vibrating object - the air molecules can cause other things to vibrate (such as our eardrums, or a part of a microphone) and we can quantify the level of sound by measuring the motion of the detector in any number of ways.</p>\\n\\n<p>At a deeper level, sound waves are the \"Goldstone modes\" corresponding to broken translational symmetry of the surrounding medium.  </p>\\n\\n<p>Let me try to bring this a little more down to earth.  Think about a parcel of air, large enough to contain a lot of air molecules, but not so large that there are sizable air currents swirling within.  We can think of this in an ideal situation as being a fluid of uniform density.  This fluid has translational symmetry - if I translate it a little in any direction, it looks more or less the same \"in the bulk\".  Translational symmetry is a continuous symmetry, so I can squeeze the air in a spatially-varying way.  It turns out that if I do this in a wavelike pattern with a long wavelength, this is an excitation that costs very little energy, and hence will be important to the physics.  These waves are precisely sound waves.  This probably doesn\\'t make much sense as I\\'ve written it, so I may try to edit this a bit later on if anyone is actually interested in this point of view.</p>\\n',\n",

I figure this is because the bike's momentum keeps it moving in the direction you were going, and since your wheels have friction against the ground, the top of the bike moves forward relative to the bottom of the wheels. The top of the bike going north while the bottom of the wheels go northwest will understandable cause you to topple.</p>\\n\\n<p>So to counteract this and keep you from falling over, leaning into the turn is necessary.</p>\\n\\n<p>But is there also a causal relationship -- that leaning will <strong>cause</strong> the bike to start to turn?

I experimented with unruly turns of the steering wheel when I was a kid, and got my scrapes and bruises. Now that I'm a cautious and sedate adult I'm not anxious to experiment that way. :-)</p>\\n\\n<p>(I also want to ask why airplanes bank into a turn... they don't have the same issues as a bike, i.e. the bottom part has no special friction against the ground.

So, if you move the magnetic poles against each other, you do work (against the EM field). Then, if you attach the magnets to a spring and let go, the springs will compress. The 10J of work you invested is now stored in the springs! Then, if you remove the magnets and put a bullet on the spring, and let go, you can use the 10J of energy to launch the bullet (work is converted to kinetic energy), and so on =)</p>\\n\\n<p>What happens when you push two magnets against each other, but then just hold them in place? Per the above definition of Work = Force x distance, you\\'re not doing work, because distance = 0. But clearly your muscles are straining, and you\\'re burning calories (which is just another unit of energy or work, like Joules), so what\\'s going on? From a physics textbook point of view, no work is being done. This is similar to placing an apple on a table. The table is countering the force of gravity, like your muscles in the magnet example. The table has no muscles, because it is made of wood, and it won\\'t collapse under the weight of the apple. In reality, the stiffness of the table/wood is provided by the electromagentic interactions of the atoms making up the table, so in the end it is the EM force counteracting the gravitational force. In the original magnet/muscle example, your arms are not made up of wood, so your body is doing biochemical/mechanical work to stiffen the cells in your arms by burning the food you ate. (The fact that this process is not perfect means that heat is a by product of this process, that\\'s why your muscles get hot and you start sweating.)</p>\\n',\n",

       "  'Body': '<p>The LHC is a synchrotron, that is, a accelerator with a magnetic field confining the orbit on a circular path and using RF accelerating cavities to accelerate the particles.</p>\\n\\n<p>The voltage provided by the cavities is limited (the order of MV) and thus a linear accelerator cannot achieve such high energies (of the order of the TeV) (although some projects of TeV linear collider are in development, CLIC and the ILC) because it would be extremely long. The idea is thus to have a circular path, the particle going through the cavities at each turn and gaining a small amount of energy each turn.</p>\\n\\n<p>To have this circular path, we use a magnetic field, it does not accelerate the particles, but it provides a force perpendicular to the motion, thus allowing to bend the trajectory and to obtain a circular orbit.</p>\\n\\n<p>Why does it have to be that long ? A fundamental relation for the synchrotrons is:</p>\\n\\n<p>p = q B r</p>\\n\\n<p>where p is the particle momentum, q is the charge of the particle, B is the magnetic field and r is the radius of curvature.</p>\\n\\n<p>We can then see that to have a high momentum (and energy) we need a high magnetic field and a large radius.</p>\\n\\n<p>In the LHC, the magnetic field is already at the limit of what a superconducting magnet can achieve (almost 8.5 T).</p>\\n\\n<p>The LHC then needs a very large tunnel. For that it reuses the tunnel of the LEP which was also a synchrotron, but for electrons.</p>\\n\\n<p>In that case the size of the tunnel is not really given by the same reasoning. We need to take into account the synchrotron radiation: any accelerated charge radiates energy in the form of a EM radiation: \"light\".</p>\\n\\n<p>But the amount of radiation goes with the inverse of the fourth power of the mass, the electron being very light they emit a large amount of radiation. For protons, this effects is almost negligible, that\\'s why it does count for the LHC.</p>\\n\\n<p>But for LEP (and LEP gave it\\'s tunnel to the LHC) this was the main limitation to the achieved energy. And to obtain a high energy, the larger the tunnel the better, because the amount of radiation decreases with the bending angle of the dipole magnets, meaning that a large radius leads to lower radiation.</p>\\n\\n<p>Finally, the size of precisely 27 km was chosen for geographic consideration: the tunnel is between the Jura Mountains and the Leman lake, this implies strict constraints in the civil engineering.</p>\\n',\n",

This is the sense in which charge is quantized.</li>\\n<li>In technical usage, \"quantized\" means being limited to certain discrete values, namely the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalue\">eigenvalues</a> of an operator, although those discrete values will not necessarily be multiples of a certain unit. </li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>As far as we know, mass is not quantized in either of these ways... mostly. But let\\'s leave that aside for a moment.</p>\\n\\n<p>For fundamental particles (those which are not known to be composite), we have tabulated the masses, and they are clearly not multiples of a single unit. So that rules out the first meaning of quantization. As for the second, there is no known operator whose eigenvalues correspond to (or even are proportional to) the masses of the fundamental particles. Many physicists suspect that such an operator exists and that we will find it someday, but so far there is no evidence for it, and in fact there is basically no concrete evidence that the masses of the fundamental particles have any particular significance. This is why I would not say that mass is quantized.</p>\\n\\n<p>When you consider composite particles, though, things get a little trickier. Much of their mass comes from the kinetic energy and binding energy of the constituents, not from the masses of the constituents themselves. For instance, only a small part of the mass of the proton comes from the masses of its quarks. Most of the proton\\'s mass is actually the kinetic energy of the quarks and gluons. These particles are moving around inside the proton even when the proton itself is at rest, so their energy of motion contributes to the rest mass of the proton. There is also a contribution from the potential energy that all the constituents of the proton have by virtue of being subject to the strong force. This contribution, the binding energy, is actually negative.</p>\\n\\n<p>When you put together the mass energy of the quarks, the kinetic energy, and the binding energy, you get the total energy of what we call a \"bound system of $\\\\text{uud}$ quarks.\" Why not just call it a proton? Well, there is actually a particle exactly like the proton but with a higher mass, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_baryon\">delta baryon</a> $\\\\Delta^+$. Technically, a $\\\\text{uud}$ bound system could be either a proton or a delta baryon. But we\\'ve observed that when you put these three quarks together, you only ever get $\\\\mathrm{p}^+$ (with a mass of $938\\\\ \\\\mathrm{MeV/c^2}$) or $\\\\Delta^+$ (with a mass of $1232\\\\ \\\\mathrm{MeV/c^2}$). You can\\'t get any old mass you want. This is a <em>very</em> strong indication that the mass of a $\\\\text{uud}$ bound state is quantized in the second sense. Now, the calculations involved are <em>very</em> complicated, so I\\'m not sure if the operator which produces these two masses as eigenvalues can be derived in detail, but there\\'s basically no doubt that it does exist.</p>\\n\\n<p>You can take other combinations of quarks, or even include leptons and other particles, and do the same thing with them - that is, given any particular combination of fundamental particles, you can make some number of composite particles a.k.a. bound states, and the masses of those particles will be quantized <em>given what you\\'re starting from</em>. But in general, if you start without assuming the masses of the fundamental particles, we don\\'t know that mass is quantized at all.</p>\\n',\n",

       "  'Body': '<p>One common way of making these measurements is gravitational lensing. Basically, astronomers look at some distant object which is located directly behind the galaxy in question. Since the galaxy is so massive, it bends the light from the more distant object around it, so we see an image of the object displaced by some angle from where it actually is in the sky. For a distant object in the right position, we can see multiple images, one from light deflected to the left and one from light deflected to the right. Measuring the angular separation between them allows you to compute the angle by which the light was bent, and in turn to determine the mass of the galaxy required to produce that deflection.</p>\\n\\n<p>For galaxies that are less massive but closer, close enough to resolve the spectra of individual stars, we can measure the Doppler shifts of the spectra of stars on the advancing side of the galaxy and on the receding side, and taking the difference gives (twice) the tangential speed of the stars at that radius, which is related to the amount of mass contained within that radius. So measuring the spectra of stars at the edge of the galaxy, or in e.g. a globular cluster that orbits the galaxy, can give you the total mass contained in the galaxy.</p>\\n',\n",

If there is more than one, I\\'m not sure how exactly that would change the lower and upper bounds on the mass range, but I believe that there is some possibility that if there is a Higgs multiplet, all the particles could have higher masses than we would be able to detect.

In the context in question, it has to do with whether a quantity is absolute (that is, has the same value) or relative (that is, has different values) when measured by two inertial observers moving with respect to one another.</p>\\n\\n<p>Of course, first we need to define what an inertial observer is: it's an observer for which Newton's laws are applicable without having to resort to adding fictitious forces.</p>\\n\\n<p>Ok, so now we have two observers, Alice and Bob, both of which are inertial. They both observe the motion of some object. Let the index 1 correspond to quantities measured in A's reference frame and the index 2 correspond to quantities measured in B's reference frame. The position of the object is clearly a relative concept, since</p>\\n\\n<p>r₂ = r₁ + u t</p>\\n\\n<p>(where u is the velocity of Bob with respect to Alice, and is constant since they're both inertial observers). Note that the time, t, is the same for both observers, as it must be according to Newtonian Mechanics. The object position is a relative concept because r₂ ≠ r₁.</p>\\n\\n<p>Now, take the time-derivative of both sides and we get</p>\\n\\n<p>v₂ = v₁ + u</p>\\n\\n<p>that is, the velocity of the object with respect to one observer is different than the velocity of the same object with respect to the other observer. Hence, velocity is a relative quantity in Newtonian Mechanics.</p>\\n\\n<p>Next, take the time-derivative of both sides once again, and we obtain</p>\\n\\n<p>a₂ = a₁</p>\\n\\n<p>(since u is constant). Thus, the acceleration of the object is the same in both reference frames. Acceleration, therefore, is absolute in Newtonian Mechanics.</p>\\n\\n<p>When we take into account the theory of relativity, then time flows at different rates for different inertial observers and the result above for the acceleration is no longer true. </p>\\n\",\n",

By \"messy\" I mean that the variations on the possible results of the collision (the number of different Feynmann diagrams) is pretty large. Of course, certain outcomes have much higher outcomes than others, and the probabilities of such can be estimated in quantum field theory. In any case, there can be decays into all sorts of fundamental particles (with different charges, spins, masses, etc.), and then further decays, and so forth.</p>\\n\\n<p>Verifying that a particle (here the Higgs boson) is really what the theory predicts takes lots of runs of the experiment, and is largely just a complex probability game. Given that the properties of the Higgs aren\\'t exactly known, what particle physicists are looking for is <em>signs of a missing particle</em>. i.e. A violation of some conservation law in the collision (typically energy or momentum). This is a good hint that there\\'s an unknown particle that hasn\\'t been accounted for. (For example, neutrinos are far too weakly interacting to be detected directly, and were first discovered by noticing some small energy was missing).</p>\\n\\n<p>At the moment, all we really know from previous experimental data is that the lower bound for the Higgs boson mass is 115 GeV/c² - pretty high, but theoretically well within the range of the LHC.

Before an external magnetic field is applied to the material, the domains are oriented in random directions. Their tiny magnetic fields point in random directions and cancel each other out, so the material has no overall net magnetic field. When an external magnetizing field H is applied to the material, it penetrates the material and aligns the domains, causing their tiny magnetic fields to turn and align parallel to the external field, adding together to create a large magnetic field which extends out from the material. This is called magnetization. The stronger the external magnetic field, the more the domains align. Saturation occurs when practically all the domains are lined up, so further increases in applied field can\\'t cause further alignment of the domains. This is a simplified account; a more complete explanation can be found in Ferromagnetism.</p>\\n',\n",

In fact, unless the theories are drastically wrong, the Higgs particle is unstable and it has an exceedingly short lifetime - so short that it won\\'t even make it out of the empty space inside the detector! Even at the speed of light, it can only travel a microscopic distance before it decays into other particles. (If I can find some numeric predictions I\\'ll edit that information in.)

For example, the standard model predicts that a Higgs boson could decay into two Z bosons, which in turn decay into a muon and antimuon each. So if physicists see that a particular collision produces two muons and two antimuons, among other particles, there\\'s a chance that somewhere in the mess of particles produced in that collision, there was a Higgs boson. This is just one example, of course; there are many other sets of particles that the Higgs could decay into, and the large detectors at the LHC are designed to look for all of them.</p>\\n\\n<p>Of course, Higgs decay is not the only thing that could produce two muon-antimuon pairs, and the same is true for other possible decay products. So just seeing the expected decay products is not a sure sign of a Higgs detection. The real evidence is going to come from the results of many collisions (billions or trillions), accumulated over time.</p>\\n\\n<p>For each possible set of decay products, you can plot the fraction of collisions in which those decay products are produced (or rather, the scattering cross section, a related quantity) against the total energy of the particles coming into the collision. If the Higgs is real, you\\'ll see a spike, called a <em>resonance</em>, in the graph at the energy corresponding to the mass of the Higgs particle. It\\'ll look something like this plot, which was produced for the Z boson (which has a mass of only 91 GeV):</p>\\n\\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WG79M.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WG79M.png\" alt=\"Z boson resonance plot\"></a></p>\\n\\n<p>The image is from <a href=\"http://blogs.uslhc.us/the-z-boson-and-resonances\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://blogs.uslhc.us/the-z-boson-and-resonances</a>, which is actually a pretty good read.</p>\\n\\n<p>Anyway, to sum up: the main signature of the Higgs boson, like other unstable particles, will be this resonance peak that appears in a graph produced by aggregating data from many billions or trillions of collisions. Hopefully this makes it a bit clearer why there\\'s going to be a lot of detailed analysis involved before we get any clear detection or non-detection of the Higgs particle.</p>\\n',\n",

But to fully understand it, you must <strong>give up</strong> a particle as a <strong>point-like thing that is well-localized</strong>. There is <strong>one Quantum Field per sort of particle</strong>, e.g. <em>the</em> electron field for <em>all</em> electrons, and <em>the</em> photon field for all photons.

Now QFT, more specifically <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics\">Quantum Electrodynamcis</a> (<strong>QED</strong>), describes the local <strong>interaction between the electron field and the photon field</strong>. But since the fields have a dynamic, <strong>a local change</strong> induced in the photon field by the electron field <strong>will propagate</strong> with the speed of light (flat space assumed) and interact with the electron field in another place, thus creating the <strong>impression</strong> \"Electron A emitted a photon that told electron B to interact electromagnetically\".</p>\\n\\n<p>It\\'s similar for the other interactions, there\\'s a gluon field for the strong interaction (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chromodynamics\">Quantum Chromodynamics</a>), and for the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroweak_interaction\">electroweak interaction</a> there\\'s kind of a combination of the photon field and the weak-interaction-bosons.</p>\\n',\n",

Do they communicate with each other somehow through some means?</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>Yes, specifically the electromagnetic field. To give a simplistic view, a charged particle produces an electric field to indicate its presence and a magnetic field to indicate its motion. Any disturbance in these fields propagates outward at the speed of light. Another charged particle some distance away can react to the fields; if it \"feels\" the presence of an electric field, it will move in response.</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>I\\'ve heard some people tell me that they bounce together messenger photons.

Personally I don\\'t think it\\'s a very good one, but we don\\'t really have anything better. The thing is, even though disturbances in the EM field propagate like waves, when a particle reacts to such a disturbance, it acts as though another particle collided with it. In order to make this fit with our intuition, we\\'re forced to invent the idea that there are particles, or <em>quanta</em>, associated with the electromagnetic field, and we call them photons.</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>Aren\\'t photons also associated with energy, as well? Does this type of mediation imply that electrons give off energy in order to exert force on other electrons?</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>Yep. To make sense of this, you really have to consider the whole system of <em>both</em> electrons, as well as the EM field itself. Each electron \"feels\" the electromagnetic field produced by the other, so both electrons\\' motions will change in such a way that the total energy is conserved.</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>Every electron is repelled by every other electron in the universe, right?

However, the electron only disturbs the field when its motion (or quantum state, rather) <em>changes</em>. An electron stuck in a single quantum state, such as an atomic orbital, won\\'t be radiating any energy.</p>\\n\\n<p>The bottom line is that I would advise you not to take the idea of \"messenger photons\" too literally.

In fact, you don\\'t even need to involve the strong force or weak force (or the strong nuclear force, which is sort of different).

       "  'Body': '<p>I\\'m working on a graphic simulation (just for fun, for an open-source screensaver) of an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerotrim\" rel=\"nofollow\">Aerotrim</a> - a \"human gyroscope\", one of those exercise/training machines with a human in the middle, perched on a ring that swivels on an axis with respect to another ring, which swivels on an axis perpendicular to the first axis, on another ring. (AFAICT there could be 2 or 3 such axes that turn, each at right angles to the next. If I can simulate 2 axes / 3 rings, that would be sufficient. A general solution for n rings would be lovely. :-) </p>\\n\\n<p>Simulating the thing turning, with each axis rotating at a constant rate, is no problem. But it would \"feel\" more real if I could apply some realistic acceleration from the interaction between the rings and the mass of the rider.</p>\\n\\n<p>In the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=aerotrim&amp;page=&amp;utm_source=opensearch\" rel=\"nofollow\">Youtube videos</a>, you sometimes see a bystander push on one of the rings, to help get the rider going. Not only does that ring accelerate, but others start spinning too. And the pushed ring does not accelerate smoothly, but undergoes resistance from the other rings, apparently transferring acceleration to them.</p>\\n\\n<p>I am not up on angular momentum, torque, and all that, so answers will need to take my ignorance into account, though I\\'m obviously willing to learn a few things as necessary. </p>\\n\\n<p>I don\\'t feel like it\\'s necessary to take into account the asymmetry of the person\\'s mass - modeling the person as a point mass in the center of the rings should be fine, I think. In other words I don\\'t plan on modeling the way that the rider accelerates the rings by leaning one way or another.</p>\\n\\n<p>I was thinking that in order to make things a little more interesting, I would have the program occasionally apply a force like a hand pushing on one of the rings. I can figure out what the torque on that ring would be if it were independent of the others, but I don\\'t know to model a set of 3 rings connected on axes.</p>\\n\\n<p>Any thoughts on how I could model the interaction between the rings, each affecting the others? Simplifications are fine. My intent is not to discover new phenomena through accurate physical modeling, but to create a visual display that <em>looks</em> more realistic than just rings turning at constant rates.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> </p>\\n\\n<p>P.S. Part of my uncertainty is, how much does the Aerotrim really behave like a gyroscope? The gyroscope\\'s main properties are focused on the mass in the middle spinning fast on its axis, and therefore its axis tends not to move. This is obviously different from the aerotrim, where the person is often not rotating much around the inner axis, and the inner axis is certainly not staying still. I wonder if other factors, like the conservation of angular momentum of the <em>outer</em> rings, plays more of a part in the Aerotrim that is negligible with gyroscopes.</p>\\n\\n<p>If it <em>is</em> essentially just a gyroscope... I\\'ve looked at the \"fundamental equation\" at <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyroscope#Properties\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyroscope#Properties</a>, but as a non-physicist I find it difficult to imagine how to turn that into code computing what happens when a force is applied. Pointers to example code for simulation of gyroscopes would be appreciated.</p>\\n\\n<p>Thanks,</p>\\n\\n<p>Lars</p>\\n',\n",

It starts with negatively ionised hydrogen and accelerates it using a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockcroft%E2%80%93Walton_generator\">Cockcroft-Walton</a> accelerator to 750keV, by basically cycling the ions through a potential difference multiple times. These ions are then fed into a linear accelerator that uses an oscillating electroc field to accelerate them to 400 MeV. The electrons are then stripped from the ions using a carbon foil, ending up with 400MeV protons. These then go into the Booster which accelerates them to 8GeV. </p>\\n\\n<p>This is the proton production stage and following this, the 8GeV protons are directed to the first ring of the Tevatron (the Main Injector) where they can be accelerated up to 150GeV. Once the protons reach 120GeV, some are collided with a nickel target, producing a shower of particles. The antiprotons are filtered and directed back to the Main Injector, which accelerates both the protons and antiprotons to 150GeV. The two beams are now fed into the main accelerator (the Tevatron) which accelerates them to 1TeV and crosses them at the detector site, producing the shower of particles that is detected and analysed :)</p>\\n\\n<p>References:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\"http://www.fnal.gov/pub/inquiring/physics/accelerators/chainaccel.html\">Fermilab\\'s accelerators</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"http://www.fnal.gov/pub/science/accelerator/\">Component details</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n',\n",

       "  'Body': '<p>I see that two examples in optics have been mentioned, a diffraction grating by Mark Eichenlaub, and a lens by sigoldberg1. I would like to elaborate a bit, because there is a subtle difference between the two.</p>\\n\\n<p>On the one hand, a diffraction grating separates out light of different frequencies, i.e. colors, transforming them into different positions. This is analogous to how the 1-D Fourier transform works on a sound or electrical signal.</p>\\n\\n<p>On the other hand, a lens takes the 2-D Fourier transform of a <em>monochromatic</em> light beam. Monochromatic means there is only one frequency or color. You might wonder why the Fourier transform isn\\'t a single peak, if there\\'s only one frequency in the light. That\\'s because a lens transforms <em>spatial frequencies</em> (roughly equivalent to angles, but I will explain them below) into positions. Mathematically, this is the same Fourier transform, but it transforms an entirely different property of the light.</p>\\n\\n<p>It took me the longest time to understand exactly what spatial frequencies were. I finally got it one day, reading chapter 4, \"Fourier Optics\", of Saleh and Teich\\'s <em>Fundamentals of Photonics</em>, which I whole-heartedly recommend if you don\\'t understand my explanation here.</p>\\n\\n<p>You probably learned in your class that you can write any signal as a Fourier series, which is the sum of frequency components, each with their own amplitude and phase. The Fourier transform is a sort of continuous version of that. Well, you can express any monochromatic light beam as the sum of many plane waves traveling at different angles, all with the same frequency, but each with their own amplitude and phase. Is this starting to sound familiar? Each of these plane waves is a <em>spatial frequency</em>. Just as with the step from Fourier series to Fourier transform, you can make the step from discrete spatial frequencies to 2-D Fourier transform.</p>\\n\\n<p>A positive lens focuses each of these spatial frequencies to a separate point. For example, here are illustrations of two different plane waves being focused by a lens.</p>\\n\\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/VqqtF.png\" alt=\"Plane wave hitting a lens face on\"></p>\\n\\n<p>When a plane wave hits a lens face on, the lens focuses it to a point on the optical axis, at the focal distance of the lens.</p>\\n\\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/dYKxl.png\" alt=\"Plane wave hitting a lens at an angle\"></p>\\n\\n<p>However, when the plane wave is incident at an angle, the focus is still at the focal distance, but displaced from the optical axis. This is how a lens transforms \"angle\" to position.</p>\\n\\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/MgbXE.png\" alt=\"1-D Fourier transform using a lens\"></p>\\n\\n<p>So if you have a more complicated beam made up of many spatial frequencies (which, as I said, are just plane waves), they are all focused to separate points in the same plane on the other side of the lens, one focal distance away. This is why we say it computes the 2-D Fourier transform of a monochromatic light beam. In fact, in the 1970s, when computers weren\\'t so fast, people actually experimented with using lenses to calculate Fourier transforms instantaneously!</p>\\n',\n",

By finding the angular position of the intensity peak we can infer the angle of polarisation of the incoming beam. </p>\\n\\n<p>Now, assume we shine a beam of a certain spread in the transverse plane, having different polarisations everywhere. If we shine this beam onto a polariser, we will get a pattern of intensities $I(x, y) = I_0 cos^2(\\\\theta_{beam}(x, y) - \\\\theta_{polariser})$. We can find the values of $\\\\theta_{beam}(x, y)$ as follows:</p>\\n\\n<ol>\\n<li>Calibration -- rotate $\\\\theta_{polariser}$ and calculate $\\\\max_{x, y} (\\\\theta_{beam}(x, y))$, the peak intensity. The maximum of the peak intensity over all values of $\\\\theta_{polariser}$ will give you $I_0$. </li>\\n<li>Fix $\\\\theta_{polariser}$ to the value that gives the maximum peak intensity. Now you know that you have aligned your polariser with one of the polarisations present in the beam.

Now, there are two main routes to follow: Hartree-Fock or Density Functional Theory.<br>\\nIn HF, one roughly represents the many-body weavefunction as a combination of some standard base functions -- then one can optimize their contributions to get minimal energy, yet using extended Hamiltonian to adjust the effects of such approximation. \\nIn DFT, one encouraged by Hohenberg-Kohn theorems reduces the many body weavefunction to electron probability density field (3-dimensional), and accordingly Shroedinger equation terms into density functionals (and there approximations are applied). Next, it can be either solved as this 3D field or in Kohn-Sham way, which is pretty much Hartree-Fock for DFT (one represents density with base functions).\\nPeople sometimes are making something analytical here, but those are mostly theories made to support computational approaches. </p>\\n\\n<p>And finally your last question: those approximate methods (but still <em>ab initio</em> -- there are no experimental parameters there) do predict things like chemical reactions, various spectra and other measurable quantities; accuracy is problematic though.

It is simply that in general there is not a closed form analytic solution, which is why we must rely on numerics.</p>\\n\\n<p>For quantum mechanics, however, the problem is much harder. This is because in quantum mechanics, the state space required to represent the system must be able to represent all possible superpositions of particles. While the number of orthogonal states is exponential in the size of the system, each has an associated phase and amplitude, which even with the most coarse grain discretization will lead to a double exponential in the number of possible states required to represent it. Thus in quantum systems you need $O(2^{2^n})$ variables to reasonable approximate any possible state of the system, versus only $O(2^n)$ required to represent an analogous classical system. Since we can represent $2^m$ states with $m$ bits, to represent the classical state space we need only $O(n)$ bits, versus $O(2^n)$ bits required to directly represent the quantum system. This is why it is believed to be impossible to simulate a quantum computer in polynomial time, but Newtonian physics can be simulated in polynomial time.</p>\\n\\n<p>Calculating ground states is even harder than simulating the systems. Indeed, in general finding the ground state of a classical Hamiltonian is <a href=\"https://complexityzoo.uwaterloo.ca/Complexity_Zoo:N#np\" rel=\"noreferrer\">NP-complete</a>, while finding the ground state of a quantum Hamiltonian is <a href=\"https://complexityzoo.uwaterloo.ca/Complexity_Zoo:Q#qma\" rel=\"noreferrer\">QMA-complete</a>.

       "  'Body': '<p>Apologies in advance if the first part of this comes off a bit argumentative, but I think there is an important point about physical theory that should be made.  This point is also implicit in David Zaslavsky\\'s answer as well.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Rant on effective theories</h2>\\n\\n<p>Actually trying to calculate macroscopic properties like \"chemistry\" from fundamental theories like QCD and QED, or string theory, etc. seems to me to be missing the point of much of modern physics.  In particular, there\\'s enough of a separation of length, energy, and time scales that the \"physics\" that goes into the boiling point of Nitrogen is almost completely disjoint from the physics of quarks and and the nucleus.  </p>\\n\\n<p>Indeed, if to do any physics we had to start from the very bottom every time, science in a form usable and comprehensible by humans could not exist!  One of the deepest ideas of the 20th century is the notion of \"effective field theory and renormalization\" which to me makes clear why we can treat all the effects coming from high-energy physics as \"just\" couplings going into our vastly more useful phenomenological theories, i.e. all we get out of particle physics is some numbers such as the mass of various particles, or effective interaction potentials such as the Coulomb interaction, etc. and these numbers are just as useful if you measure them from doing experiments as if you were to calculate them.  (And as calculating many of these (with some notable exceptions) involves intractable many-body problems, at this point in time it\\'s actually much more accurate to measure them).</p>\\n\\n<h2>Breakdown of scales</h2>\\n\\n<p>In this particular case of determining boiling points, let me lay out what I think the relevant scales are from the bottom up and perhaps real experts can come by and correct me.  </p>\\n\\n<h3>QCD and \"below\"</h3>\\n\\n<p>First of all, effects from nuclear physics and below are totally negligible, as pointed out by David Zaslavsky already.  So we can just treat the nuclei (and electrons) as single particles and take the masses as something given from measurement.  If you wanted to calculate these masses, it\\'s my impression that there are pretty good models for the masses of nuclei if you have the masses of protons and neutrons.  However, the masses of protons and neutrons have not been (directly) calculated to any reasonable accuracy up until fairly recently, if at all.  And these models assume certain values for quark masses, which I think nobody really knows how to calculate at all.  In any case, you could certainly dig deeper and deeper with respect to calculating the masses of things, but other effects won\\'t be important for the boiling point of nitrogen.  </p>\\n\\n<h3>QED and quantum mechanics</h3>\\n\\n<p>Second, higher corrections from QED and indeed, even quantum effects between molecules will probably be ignorable too, since for Nitrogen at its boiling temperature, the molecules will be far away from quantum coherence (I\\'m less sure of this, but a quick check by estimating the de Broglie wavelength seems to work out; note that this will not be true for liquid Helium or Hydrogen).  What this means is that you can probably get away with treating the Nitrogen molecules as classical (dumbbell-shaped) dipoles with an effective pair interaction coming, as David Zaslavsky pointed out, from a single-molecule quantum ab initio calculation.  I\\'m not sure if current techniques allow for this to be done with any reasonable accuracy, but with 14 electrons, it is a fairly serious problem not too far away from the current frontiers in the field of quantum chemistry.</p>\\n\\n<h3>Classical molecular dynamics</h3>\\n\\n<p>Now we get to scales which are to me, more interesting, and where the physics of boiling finally appears.</p>\\n\\n<p>As David Zaslavsky and mbq have pointed out, boiling point is a thermodynamic property, thus it is something which only exists for a macroscopic number of molecules.  That said, one won\\'t need to attempt a simulation with 10^23 Nitrogen molecules to get a reasonable estimate; one of the triumphs of statistical mechanics is an understanding of how to estimate \"finite-size effects\"; however, it should be emphasized that this is yet another many-body problem (read as, impossible to solve analytically, requires difficult computer simulation to get right).  </p>\\n\\n<p>So finally, to get the boiling point, you could model Nitrogen molecules as some kind of pair-interacting dipolar gas in a classical molecular dynamics simulation at fixed pressure, say, and tune the temperature up until the molecules in your simulation begin to behave in a gaslike way rather than liquidlike (this \"behavior\" can be made more precise with the notion of pair correlation functions, for instance).  Note a few things here.  The greatest error in your estimation will be coming from your ability to put in a bunch of particles here in a controlled fashion in your simulation.  This is going to vastly outweigh any error from the steps \"further up\" other than having a good effective potential.  This explains why scientists who actually do molecular dynamics simulation don\\'t spend that much time worrying about QCD and particle physics.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Places to start looking and references</h2>\\n\\n<p>OK, that all written, I\\'ve looked around for some references that would be useful on molecular dynamics simulation of liquid nitrogen.</p>\\n\\n<p><a href=\"http://www.springerlink.com/content/72175162x0458032/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dominique Levesque and Jean Jacques Weis write in the 1992 book The Monte Carlo Method in Condensed Matter Physics</a> a chapter \"Recent progress in the simulation of classical fluids\" which goes over the main computational techniques commonly used now.

I\\'ve attached a figure from the paper which shows the liquid-vapor coexistence curve as a function of density, from which you could read off boiling point if you wanted.  The agreement is pretty amazing, and they do use the strategy I outlined above - simulate Nitrogen as a classical fluid with a tuned intermolecular potential; their source for the potential is apparently <a href=\"http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/tandf/tmph/1980/00000041/00000006/art00011\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">C.S.

       "  'Body': \"<p>First of all, the scheme of the CERN accelerator complex you posted contains not only that single chain which brings the protons to the LHC, but also several other chains which are used for many lower energy experiments conducted in parallel at CERN. </p>\\n\\n<p>But let's focus on the LHC accelerator chain: why do we need several successive accelerators instead of a single one? The answer is very intuitive from the engineering point of view: technologically, it is much easier to construct several devices specialized for different but <strong>limited ranges</strong> of some physical parameter than to build a single device that exhibits excellent performance in the <strong>entire vast range</strong>. </p>\\n\\n<p>An example in transportation: cars are good to travel at lower speed, airplanes are good for traveling fast. It is exceedingly difficult to build a vehicle that would have equally good performance in the entire range of speeds from 1 km/h to 1000 km/h. Another example is given by professional acoustic systems which usually include several speakers optimized for different frequency ranges.</p>\\n\\n<p>The same thing for the accelerators. Here the key point is not the energy of the protons <em>per se</em>, but the quality of the beam at a given energy. Accelerating protons is (technically) a minor issue; the major issue is to keep the beam safe and well-behaved. If you dig a bit into the CERN website, you'll soon realize that these accelerators have quite distinct features and each of them was optimized for its own energy range and its own purposes. Some of them serve to accumulate particles, other are specialized in breaking the beams into bunches. At each stage you need to cool the beams down, dump oscillations, etc., and this is done in a different way at different energies. </p>\\n\\n<p>In principle, you could think of an accelerator that would occupy the LHC ring and would take the protons at a very low energy (say, 1 MeV) and accelerate them up to multi-TeV. Since the protons must always circulate in the same ring, the magnetic field must be adjustable (with very high precision and very high spacial homogeneity) from few microtesla to several tesla, in the range of six orders of magnitude. The beam monitoring system must also be adapted to accurately measure the proton currents differing by 6 orders of magnitude. The similar requirements are placed on the beam steering, orbit correcting and focusing magnets, on the kicker magnets, and on many other components of the accelerator. In short, although technically possible, it would be just too difficult and too expensive. A sequence of several accelerators (which existed before the LHC anyway) is a preferred solution.</p>\\n\",\n",

       "  'Body': '<p>David Zaslavsky\\'s answer goes most of the way toward answering the question \"what is needed to claim the discovery of a new particle?\", but to claim discovery of <em>the</em> Higgs boson, one needs much more. The first sign that the particle really is the predicted Higgs will be the decay modes it shows up in. The Standard Model makes a specific prediction for the rate of different types of Higgs events as a function of its mass. It could decay to two Z bosons, each decaying to two muons, as David Zaslavsky explained, but only if it is heavy enough. If it\\'s lighter, it would decay mostly to bottom and anti-bottom quarks, which are quite difficult to see because ordinary strong interactions produce them much more often. It would also decay rarely to two photons, but this is a distinctive enough signal that it\\'s relatively easy to study. The rate and type of events that are seen would be checked against predictions of the Standard Model for the observed mass. For instance, if a signal showed up involving 4 muons, but at a mass of only 100 GeV, we would know that we weren\\'t seeing the Higgs, but something stranger and not predicted. Or if a 160 GeV particle were found to frequently decay to two photons, we would know that it isn\\'t the Higgs, which at that mass would decay mostly to a pair of Z or W bosons. So there are a number of consistency checks to make between the mass and decay modes. Still, much more is needed to really say that it is the Higgs. For one thing, it should be a scalar, i.e. a particle without spin. The spin can be tested by looking at the angular separation among decay products. The Higgs also interacts with known particles in very specific ways; as many tests of this as possible would be performed. Even if the particle is not the Standard Model Higgs, it still might be a type of Higgs boson in an extended theory, such as the supersymmetric Standard Model. The road from discovering <em>some</em> new particle to having a completely convincing theoretical account of what the particle is could potentially be a long one, and might even involve other colliders in the future (like the proposed International Linear Collider).</p>\\n\\n<p>For now, of course, we\\'re all just hoping for <em>something</em> to be discovered; once this happens, the work of pinning down precisely what the discovery means will be exciting and will continue for years.</p>\\n',\n",

       "  'Body': '<p>There are actually several different ways to interpret that question, depending on what you mean by \"vector\" and \"rotation\". But here\\'s a sense that I\\'ve often wondered about myself: in introductory physics, the velocity vector is defined as the time derivative of the position vector (relative to some fixed point). Why is the same not true of angular velocity - that is, why isn\\'t there an \"angular position vector\" which angular velocity can be the derivative of?</p>\\n\\n<p>As a matter of fact, sometimes there is. Think about this simple case: pick a single, fixed rotation axis and only consider rotations about that axis. (2D rotations, if you prefer to think of it that way) You\\'d pick a certain orientation to be the \"origin,\" and you could actually define an angular position vector, pointing along the rotational axis, with length equal to the amount of rotation relative to that \"origin\" orientation.</p>\\n\\n<p>Now, suppose your object\\'s angular position is changing over time. You can take the derivative of the angular position vector, and hopefully you can see that what you\\'d get is just the good old angular velocity. No problem there.</p>\\n\\n<p>But we live in a 3D world (relativity notwithstanding), so what happens when you try to generalize that model to 3 dimensions? That\\'s where you run into problems. As an example, take the object from the last paragraph, which was rotating around one particular axis - say, the $\\\\hat{z}$ axis. Now suppose it changes its motion so that it starts rotating around a different axis, maybe the $\\\\hat{x}$ axis. How will you represent its orientation now?</p>\\n\\n<p>You might be tempted to use an \"angular position vector\" pointing in the $\\\\hat{z}$ direction, whose length represents the amount of rotation around the $\\\\hat{z}$ axis, and another \"angular position vector\" pointing in the $\\\\hat{x}$ direction, whose length represents the amount of rotation around the $\\\\hat{x}$ axis. After all, that works for position. But it doesn\\'t work for angular position. The reason why is that <strong>rotations do not commute</strong>, to use the technical lingo. What that means is that if you apply rotation A to an object and follow it up by rotation B which is around a different axis, you get a different result than if you apply rotation B followed by rotation A.</p>\\n\\n<p>This little issue gets in the way if you try to combine your two $x$- and $z$- angular position vectors into one overall angular position vector. Presumably, you would write this overall vector as $(\\\\theta_x, 0, \\\\theta_z)$ (the zero might represent the amount of rotation around the $\\\\hat{y}$ axis). That vector would represent the sum of $\\\\theta_x$ times the unit rotation around the $\\\\hat{x}$ direction and $\\\\theta_z$ times the unit rotation around the $\\\\hat{z}$ direction. But it\\'s missing a critical piece of information: which of those rotations was performed first? If you gave that vector to your physicist friend, he would be unable to reproduce the orientation of the object because he doesn\\'t know whether to perform the $x$-rotation or the $z$-rotation first. Sure, <em>you</em> may know that the object was rotated in the $z$-direction first, but that information needs to be contained in the vector for it to be of any use.</p>\\n\\n<p>The point of the last paragraph is that there\\'s no way to sensibly create linear combinations of these \"angular position vectors.\" And that pretty much ruins their usefulness, because the ability to be linearly combined is absolutely fundamental to the definition of a vector, and it underlies a <em>lot</em> of the analytical techniques we use in physics.</p>\\n\\n<p>By the way, in this view, the reason matrices work to represent rotations is that matrices offer you an additional operation, multiplication, which you can use to combine them. It happens that matrix multiplication, for certain matrices (3x3 antisymmetric with determinant 1), has the same properties as composing rotations; most notably, it\\'s also noncommutative. Multiplying matrix A by matrix B can give you a different result from multiplying matrix B by matrix A.</p>\\n',\n",

Toward the end, it shows you the basic ideas behind spontaneous symmetry breaking and the Higgs mechanism, which shows you where this prediction of the Higgs boson comes from.</p>\\n\\n<p>If you want to get into more mathematical detail, another book I could recommend is <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0471887412\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Halzen and Martin</a>. It dates back to 1984 but the physics is still basically correct. I\\'ve found that that book takes a lot more effort to work through - that is, you actually have to slow down and think about what you\\'re reading, and work through some of the math, but as long as you put the time in, the understanding you gain is well worth it.</p>\\n',\n",

       "  'Body': '<p>First of all, let me start out by pointing out to you that there have been experimental violations of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell%27s_inequalities\">Bell\\'s inequalities</a>. This provides damning evidence against hidden variable models of quantum mechanics, and thus essentially proves that the random outcomes are an essential feature of quantum mechanics. If the outcomes of measurements in every basis were predetermined, we should not be able to violate Bell\\'s inequality.</p>\\n\\n<p>One way of seeing why this is in fact a reasonable state of affairs is to consider Schroedinger\\'s cat. Evolution of closed quantum systems is unitary, and hence entirely deterministic. For example, in the case of the cat, at some point in time we have a state of the system which is a superposition of (atom decayed and cat dead) and (atom undecayed and cat alive) with equal amplitude for each. This far quantum mechanics predicts the exact state of the system. We need to consider what happens when we open the box and look at the cat. When we do this, the system should then be in a superposition of (atom decayed, cat dead, box open, you aware cat is dead) and (atom undecayed, cat alive, box closed, you aware cat is alive). Clearly as time goes on the two branches of the wave function diverge further as the consequences of whether the cat is alive or dead propagate out into the world, and as a result no interference is likely possible. Thus there are two branches of the wave function with different configurations of the world. If you believe the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everett_interpretation\">Everett interpretation</a> of quantum mechanics then both branches continue to exist indefinitely. Clearly our thinking depends on whether we have seen the cat alive or dead so that we ourselves are in a state (seen cat dead and aware we have seen the cat dead and not seen the cat alive) or (seen cat alive and aware we have seen the cat alive and not seen the cat dead). Thus even if we exist in a superposition we are only aware of a classical outcome to the experiment. Quantum mechanics allows us to calculate the exact wavefunction which is the outcome of the experiment, however, it cannot tell us a priori which branch we will find ourselves aware of after the experiment. This isn\\'t really a shortcoming of the mathematical framework, but rather of our inability to perceive ourselves in anything other than classical states.</p>\\n',\n",

       "  'Body': '<p>I\\'m not an expert in peepholes specifically, but as far as I know, there are a couple of factors that give a peephole its peculiar properties.</p>\\n\\n<p>First, according to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peephole\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a>, the hole is fitted with a fisheye lens. This is a lens that, in one direction, takes a very wide field of view (up to a full half-sphere) and focuses it into a small area. This diagram should give you a rough idea (although this is certainly not exactly accurate to reality; maybe I\\'ll do a better one later):</p>\\n\\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y4cJx.png\" alt=\"fisheye lens ray diagram\"></p>\\n\\n<p>The lens is mounted such that it gathers light rays from all angles on the outside of the door, and focuses them on a small pupil-sized region on the inside of the door, so that you (being on the inside) can see whatever is on the outside, through a wide range of angles. This also has the effect of concentrating the light from a large area on the outside into a small area on the inside, thus increasing the intensity (power per unit area), thus making the image brighter.</p>\\n\\n<p>However, the same process also works in reverse, and that\\'s why the peephole makes it difficult for people to see into your room. If your eye, on the inside, can see a wide range of angles from the outside, a person on the outside can only see a small range of angles from the inside. So they wind up getting a magnified view of a small part of your eye, basically. Also, just as the peephole makes the image outside appear brighter to you, it makes you on the inside appear dimmer to a person on the outside, by spreading the light coming out over a large angular area.</p>\\n\\n<p>One other factor that tends to help, at least for houses during the daytime, is that there\\'s a lot more light outside than there is inside, so someone attempting to peer in through your peephole also has to deal with reflection of the exterior light getting in the way. (This particular effect also works with windows)</p>\\n',\n",

So back then, people who were interested in theoretical computer science got their doctorate in Mathematics, and people who were interested in applied computer science got their degrees in a field of the natural sciences.  Since physics offers the most readily answerable questions computationally, particularly with the computational power available in the 1950s and 1960s, many applied computer scientists ended up in physics programs.  When schools began to offer full bachelor's, master's, and doctoral programs in computer science, these people returned to their first love.  (I gathered most of this from talking to a CS professor I had in undergrad who followed exactly the same path you describe.)  I'm pretty sure there are a lot more physics Ph.D.s in computer science professorships than vice versa (even though I'm sure there are exceptions, and I'll get several comments pointing this out).  I realize there is a lot of overlap between the two fields, but if you want to know the real reason what there are so many <em>professors</em> in CS from physics, this is why.</p>\\n\",\n",

For your purposes, you might consider reading the first few chapters just to get the \"big picture\" if you find other books to be a bit too much at first.</li>\\n<li><a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0521887054\">A First Course in General Relativity</a> by <strong>Bernard Schutz</strong> is one that I\\'ve heard similar things about, but I haven\\'t read it myself.</li>\\n<li><a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0805387323\">Spacetime and Geometry: An Introduction to General Relativity</a> by <strong>Sean Carroll</strong> is one that I\\'ve used a bit, and which goes into a slightly higher level of mathematical detail than Hartle. It introduces the basics of differential geometry and uses them to discuss the formulation of tensors, connections, and the metric (and then of course it goes on into the theory itself and applications). It\\'s based on <a href=\"http://preposterousuniverse.com/grnotes/\">these notes</a> which are available for free.</li>\\n<li><a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0226870332\">General Relativity</a> by <strong>Robert M. Wald</strong> is a classic, though I\\'m a little embarrassed to admit that I haven\\'t read much of it. From what I know, though, there\\'s certainly no shortage of mathematical detail, and it derives/explains certain principles in different ways from other books, so it can either be a good reference on its own (if you\\'re up for the detail) or a good companion to whatever else you\\'re reading. However it was published back in 1984 and thus doesn\\'t cover a lot of recent developments, e.g. the accelerating expansion of the universe, cosmic censorship, various results in semiclassical gravity and numerical relativity, and so on.</li>\\n<li><a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0716703440\">Gravitation</a> by <strong>Charles Misner, Kip Thorne, and John Wheeler</strong>, is pretty much the authoritative reference on general relativity (to the extent that one exists). It discusses many aspects and applications of the theory in far more mathematical and logical detail than any other book I\\'ve seen. (Consequently, it\\'s very thick.) I would recommend having a copy of this around as a reference to go to about specific topics, when you have questions about the explanations in other books, but it\\'s not the kind of thing you\\'d sit down and read large chunks of at once. It\\'s also worth noting that this dates back to 1973, so it\\'s out of date in the same ways as Wald\\'s book (and more).</li>\\n<li><a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0471925675\">Gravitation and Cosmology: Principles and Applications of the General Theory of Relativity</a> by <strong>Steven Weinberg</strong> is another one that I\\'ve read a bit of. Honestly I find it a bit hard to follow - just like some of Weinberg\\'s other books, actually - since he gets into such detailed explanations, and it\\'s easy to get bogged down in trying to understand the details and forget about the main point of the argument. Still, this might be another one to go to if you\\'re wondering about the details omitted by other books. This is not as comprehensive as the Misner/Thorne/Wheeler book, though.</li>\\n<li><a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0521537800\">A Relativist\\'s Toolkit: The Mathematics of Black-Hole Mechanics</a> by <strong>Eric Poisson</strong> is a bit beyond the purely introductory level, but it does provide practical guidance on doing certain calculations which is missing from a lot of other books.</li>\\n</ul>\\n',\n",

An electron is travelling along from the lower right, interacts with some light energy and starts travelling backwards in time. An electron travelling backwards in time is what we call a positron. In the diagram, the electron travelling backwards in time interacts with some other light energy and starts travelling forwards in time again. Note that throughout, there is only one electron.</p>\\n\\n<p>A friend of mine finds the image of an electron travelling backwards in time, interpreted by us as a positron, to be scary.</p>\\n\\n<p>Feynman in his original paper proposing this theory wrote:</p>\\n\\n<p>\"It is as though a bombardier flying low over a road suddenly sees three roads and it is only when two of them come together and disappear again that he realizes that he has simply passed over a long switchback in a single road.\" (Physical Review 76, (1949), 749.)</p>\\n\\n<p>Note that Feynman\\'s theory is yet another echo of the fact, noted above, that a negatively charged object moving from left to right in a magnetic field has the same curvature as a positive object moving from right to left.</p>\\n\\n<p>Feynman\\'s theory is mathematically equivalent to Dirac\\'s, although the interpretations are quite different. Which formalism a physicist uses when dealing with antimatter is usually a matter of which form has the simplest structure for the particular problem being solved.</p>\\n\\n<p>Note that in Feynman\\'s theory, there is no pair production or annihilation. Instead the electron is just interacting with electromagnetic radiation, i.e. light. Thus the whole process is just another aspect of the fact that accelerating electric charges radiate electric and magnetic fields; here the radiation process is sufficiently violent to reverse the direction of the electron\\'s travel in time.</p>\\n\\n<p>Nambu commented on Feynman\\'s theory in 1950:</p>\\n\\n<p>\"The time itself loses sense as the indicator of the development of phenomena; there are particles which flow down as well as up the stream of time; the eventual creation and annihilation of pairs that may occur now and then is no creation or annihilation, but only a change of direction of moving particles, from past to future, or from future to past.\" (Progress in Theoretical Physics 5, (1950) 82).</p>\\n\\n<p>About Formally Equivalent Descriptions ....\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Then you mix in another very interesting problem, namely the origin of the apparent matter antimatter asymmetry in the observable universe (observed absence of annihilation radiation except in special circumstances) and point out that it may be related to a very very hard problem indeed, namely the origin of time asymmetry.   One problem at a time, please.  Maybe separate questions, but the answers will likely be more or less over your head since, to the extent that they are even partially understood, they are still being figured out. </p>\\n',\n",

       "  'Body': '<p>To the best of my knowledge, most physicists don\\'t believe that antimatter is <em>actually</em> matter moving backwards in time. It\\'s not even entirely clear what would it really mean to move backwards in time, from the popular viewpoint.</p>\\n\\n<p>If I\\'m remembering correctly, this idea all comes from a story that probably originated with Richard Feynman. At the time, one of the big puzzles of physics was why all instances of a particular elementary particle (all electrons, for example) are apparently identical. Feynman had a very hand-wavy idea that all electrons could in fact be the same electron, just bouncing back and forth between the beginning of time and the end. As far as I know, that idea never developed into anything mathematically grounded, but it did inspire Feynman and others to calculate what the properties of an electron moving backwards in time would be, in a certain precise sense that emerges from quantum field theory. What they came up with was a particle that matched the known properties of the positron.</p>\\n\\n<p>Just to give you a rough idea of what it means for a particle to \"move backwards in time\" in the technical sense: in quantum field theory, particles carry with them amounts of various conserved quantities as they move. These quantities may include energy, momentum, electric charge, \"flavor,\" and others. As the particles move, these conserved quantities produce \"currents,\" which have a direction based on the motion and sign of the conserved quantity. If you apply the time reversal operator (which is a purely mathematical concept, not something that actually reverses time), you reverse the direction of the current flow, which is equivalent to reversing the sign of the conserved quantity, thus (roughly speaking) turning the particle into its antiparticle.</p>\\n\\n<p>For example, consider electric current: it arises from the movement of electric charge, and the direction of the current is a product of the direction of motion of the charge and the sign of the charge.</p>\\n\\n<p>$$\\\\vec{I} = q\\\\vec{v}$$</p>\\n\\n<p>Positive charge moving left ($+q\\\\times -v$) is equivalent to negative charge moving right ($-q\\\\times +v$). If you have a current of electrons moving to the right, and you apply the time reversal operator, it converts the rightward velocity to leftward velocity ($-q\\\\times -v$). But you would get the exact same result by instead converting the electrons into positrons and letting them continue to move to the right ($+q\\\\times +v$); either way, you wind up with the net positive charge flow moving to the right.</p>\\n\\n<p>By the way, optional reading if you\\'re interested: there is a very basic (though hard to prove) theorem in quantum field theory, the TCP theorem, that says that if you apply the three operations of time reversal, charge conjugation (switch particles and antiparticles), and parity inversion (mirroring space), the result should be exactly equivalent to what you started with. We know from experimental data that, under certain exotic circumstances, the combination of charge conjugation and parity inversion does <em>not</em> leave all physical processes unchanged, which means that the same must be true of time reversal: <em>physics is</em> not <em>time-reversal invariant</em>. Of course, since we can\\'t <em>actually</em> reverse time, we can\\'t test in exactly what manner this is true.</p>\\n',\n",

       "  'Body': '<p>In experimental high energy physics, the beam energy is well known. For example, if you have a beam of protons, you <em>know</em> the energy because the engineers controlling the accelerator make sure that the beam is very well collimated, and goes on track, etc. If it weren\\'t so, the beam would hit the pipe walls and you\\'d lose it... There are also instruments along the beam pipe which measure the current, so all that is used to control the total energy of the beam.</p>\\n\\n<p>Secondly, experimental particle physicists <em>seldomly look into individual collisions</em> &mdash; because there are millions of collisions per second, with millions of electronic channels, the pile up of collision events is not negligible (typically 10-20 events per \"frame\"). It\\'s simply too complicated (and error prone) to look at individual events. To make stand out the potentially interesting events from the manifestly uninteresting background events (those too common and already studied, such as low-mass-particle decays), they make specific cuts in quantities that they <em>know</em> (from numerical simulations) will exclude manifestly uninteresting events, and in the end you have events which are likely to be the \"type\" you\\'re looking for. On example is this: if you only accept reconstructed tracks which have a linear momentum higher than a certain value, you exclude a lot of particles (\"good\" and \"bad\") in the direction of the collision (beam-wise) but those who are scattered perpendicularly to that direction (i.e. away from the beam), <em>and</em> have a high energy, are likely to be interesting (as expected from numerical simulations, i.e. \"Monte Carlo\" as it is called). </p>\\n\\n<p>Bottom line (to make this short):</p>\\n\\n<p>They know very well what goes in, but they know not too well what goes out for <em>individual events</em>. When you only count high-energy particles (i.e. those who don\\'t bend very much under the detector\\'s strong magnetic field) and you start <em>superimposing</em> (piling up!!) all the events which have a couple (in about 100 or so) of \"promissing\" particle tracks, they start accumulating around the \"correct value\". That\\'s how they know that \"when two particles collided, a heavy one was created momentarily and it decayed into lighter ones\".</p>\\n\\n<p>You can have a clue about how piling up individual events might give the approximate good answer from this illustration:</p>\\n\\n<p>Suppose you have a glass of sand and you let it drop slowly into the floor. You then ask a friend to come into the room and tell him to make an estimation of where in the room you dropped the sand from. That should be easy. He might even make a more or less good prediction of <em>how high</em> you dropped the sand by how much it spreads on the floor (it should spread wider if dropped higher). Even if your friend knows exactly how much sand was dropped (from knowing how much sand was in the glass), he only has a \"good enough\" hint at what happened (where in the room, how high) when the sand was dropped from the glass.</p>\\n',\n",

       "  'Body': '<p>There are zero contradictions between quantum mechanics and special relativity; quantum field theory is the framework that unifies them.</p>\\n\\n<p>General relativity also works perfectly well as a low-energy effective quantum field theory. For questions like the low-energy scattering of photons and gravitons, for instance, the Standard Model coupled to general relativity is a perfectly good theory. It only breaks down when you ask questions involving invariants of order the Planck scale, where it fails to be predictive; this is the problem of \"nonrenormalizability.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Nonrenormalizability itself is no big deal; the Fermi theory of weak interactions was nonrenormalizable, but now we know how to complete it into a quantum theory involving W and Z bosons that is consistent at higher energies. So nonrenormalizability doesn\\'t necessarily point to a contradiction in the theory; it merely means the theory is incomplete. </p>\\n\\n<p>Gravity is more subtle, though: the real problem is not so much nonrenormalizability as  high-energy behavior inconsistent with local quantum field theory. In quantum mechanics, if you want to probe physics at short distances, you can scatter particles at high energies. (You can think of this as being due to Heisenberg\\'s uncertainty principle, if you like, or just about properties of Fourier transforms where making localized wave packets requires the use of high frequencies.) By doing ever-higher-energy scattering experiments, you learn about physics at ever-shorter-length scales. (This is why we build the LHC to study physics at the attometer length scale.)</p>\\n\\n<p>With gravity, this high-energy/short-distance correspondence breaks down. If you could collide two particles with center-of-mass energy much larger than the Planck scale, then when they collide their wave packets would contain more than the Planck energy localized in a Planck-length-sized region. This creates a black hole. If you scatter them at even <em>higher</em> energy, you would make an even <em>bigger</em> black hole, because the Schwarzschild radius grows with mass. So the harder you try to study shorter distances, the worse off you are: you make black holes that are bigger and bigger and swallow up ever-larger distances. No matter what completes general relativity to solve the renormalizability problem, the physics of <em>large</em> black holes will be dominated by the Einstein action, so we can make this statement even without knowing the full details of quantum gravity.</p>\\n\\n<p>This tells us that quantum gravity, at very high energies, is <em>not</em> a quantum field theory in the traditional sense. It\\'s a stranger theory, which probably involves a subtle sort of nonlocality that is relevant for situations like black hole horizons.</p>\\n\\n<p>None of this is really a <em>contradiction</em> between general relativity and quantum mechanics. For instance, string theory is a quantum mechanical theory that includes general relativity as a low-energy limit. What it does mean is that quantum field theory, the framework we use to understand all non-gravitational forces, is not sufficient for understanding gravity. Black holes lead to subtle issues that are still not fully understood.</p>\\n',\n",

Basically, the physicist hung a torsion balance from a high ceiling by a long (>10 m?) piece of computer data tape (chosen because it would not stretch).   He carefully minimized air currents.  The torsion masses were two .5 kg bottles of water on a wooden bar (no magnetic interference).   Mass, in the form of boxes of sand, say 20kg was piled around on the floor as static mass and then reversed in position with respect to the suspended masses.   There was a clear plastic box around the balance (with a hole in its top for the suspending tape to pass through) also to minimize the effect of air currents, since the lateral force on each bottle is about G*m1*m2/r^2 = (6.7e-11)*0.5kg*20kg/(0.1m)^2 N ~ 6.7e-8 N, i.e. a lateral force on each bottle equivalent to that generated by a weight of about 7 micrograms, about that of a 1 mm^3 grain of sand.   This is visible to us because the long arms of the torsion balance convert this small force into a torque on the suspending filament, and the restoring torque is itself very small.</p>\\n\\n<p>I found an Italian dubbed version of the video on Youtube.  See <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUGpF3h3RaM&amp;feature=related\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUGpF3h3RaM&amp;feature=related</a> and a slightly longer version at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hWMLjfe_M&amp;feature=related\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hWMLjfe_M&amp;feature=related</a>.   I believe the demonstrator was Prof. Jerrold Zacharias from MIT and the PSSC staff.  If anyone can point me to the original undubbed black and white film loop, I\\'d appreciate it. </p>\\n\\n<p>It looked really crude but qualitatively it worked.    The mirror moved upon reversal of the mass positions.   Yeah, experimental physics!!    Calculate it out.  Use your laser pointer.   Glue mirrors.  Calibrate.  Give it as an experiment in class.   Make a (music?) video.  Put it on Youtube and embed it here.   Social physics.</p>\\n\\n<p>I also found some other do it your self experimenters with crude equipment, experimental tips (try fishing line) and different masses.\\nSee <a href=\"http://funcall.blogspot.com/2009/04/lets-do-twist.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://funcall.blogspot.com/2009/04/lets-do-twist.html</a>\\n<a href=\"http://www.hep.fsu.edu/~wahl/phy3802/expinfo/cavendish/cenco_grav.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.hep.fsu.edu/~wahl/phy3802/expinfo/cavendish/cenco_grav.pdf</a>\\nand <a href=\"http://www.fourmilab.ch/gravitation/foobar/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.fourmilab.ch/gravitation/foobar/</a>, which uses a ladder, some cobblestones, monofilament fishing line and has videos.   For the experiment in this last reference, you don\\'t need mirrors, since you can see the balance masses move directly because their excursion is so large.   See also <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euvWU-4_B5Y\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euvWU-4_B5Y</a></p>\\n\\n<p>For all these experiments there is no calibration of the restoring force of the twisted filament (which Cavendish did from the free torsion period of the balance), the balance beam of one appears to be styrofoam, (so I would worry about subtle charge effects), and the beam hits the support of the fixed masses so that it bounces and we do not see the harmonic angular acceleration we might expect.  This last problem is apparently well known to amateur experimenters in this field.\\nAnother exposition and video is at <a href=\"http://www.juliantrubin.com/bigten/cavendishg.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.juliantrubin.com/bigten/cavendishg.html</a></p>\\n\\n<p>The best summary and historical exposition I found is at <a href=\"http://wapedia.mobi/en/Torsion_bar_experiment\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torsion_bar_experiment</a> .   I did not realize that the experiment was originally designed by John Michell, a contemporary, whose designs and apparatus passed to Cavendish upon his death.  See <a href=\"http://wapedia.mobi/en/John_Michell\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Michell</a>.  Newton had considered the deviation from vertical that a stationary pendulum would have near a terrestrial mountain in the Principia (1686).   Although he considered the deviation too small to measure, it was measured 52 years later at Chimborazo, Ecuador in 1738, which was the first experiment showing that the Earth was not hollow, apparently a live hypothesis at the time.   The same experiment was repeated in Scotland in 1774.   See <a href=\"http://wapedia.mobi/en/Schiehallion_experiment\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schiehallion_experiment</a> .  Mitchell devised the torsion balance experiment in 1783, and started construction of a torsion balance.   Cavendish did his experiment in 1797-1798.   To me this is all quite inspiring. </p>\\n\\n<p>Editorial (I\\'ll move this positive rant to meta soon) - given the obviously widely varied audience on this site, I would very much like to see more questions like this one relating to amateur or home experiments.   The analysis of the data and possible sources of errors in these experiments is often subtle, and is very instructive.    To have real physicists and other clever students publicly criticize some aspect of an experiment provides something that many students may never get otherwise.   The social network framework will help many newcomers from different countries learn what real science is in a way that yet another dose of imperfectly understood theory never will.   And it\\'s fun too.</p>\\n',\n",

The photon enter the medium, at some point it scatters off an electron or creates an electron-positron pair in a coulomb field, the initial energy distributed between the two daughter particles. Each of these particles then \"splits\" again, and so on, and as a result an electromagnetic shower develops. The typical length at which this \"doubling\" occurs is called the radiation length. This length is calculated (and measured) for many materials; it is a property of a medium and does not depend on the energy of the initial photon.

With only one plane of rotation, the torque due to a given force can be defined as</p>\\n\\n<p>$\\\\tau = rF\\\\sin\\\\theta$</p>\\n\\n<p>where $r$ is the distance from a chosen \"center of rotation\" to the point where the force is applied, and $F$ is the magnitude of the force. Now, suppose you choose the point where the staff is being held as the center of rotation. In that case, the hands exert zero torque since $r=0$ for them, but the force of gravity acts on the center of the staff, 3 feet away, so it exerts a nonzero torque. Thus the total net torque is nonzero, and the staff will drop.</p>\\n\\n<p>However, if you take into account that a person\\'s hands have some finite size, and thus they can\\'t be holding the staff <em>exactly</em> at its end, then it\\'s possible to hold it up. The force required will depend on where the hands are positioned, though.</p>\\n\\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/oppg1.png\" alt=\"force diagram\"></p>\\n\\n<p>Suppose $d$ is the width of the person\\'s hand, and suppose that the force exerted by each hand is applied exactly in the center of that hand. (This last assumption isn\\'t true but it\\'s probably good enough for a basic explanation) Then you have three forces being exerted on the staff: gravity acting through its center, the force from one hand acting at a distance $d/2$ from one end, and the force from the other hand acting at a distance $3d/2$ from that same end. In order for the staff to be stationary, all the forces have to cancel out:</p>\\n\\n<p>$-mg + F_1 + F_2 = 0$</p>\\n\\n<p>and all the torques have to cancel out:</p>\\n\\n<p>$-mg\\\\times\\\\frac{L}{2} + F_1\\\\times\\\\frac{d}{2} + F_2\\\\times\\\\frac{3d}{2} = 0$</p>\\n\\n<p>($L$ is the length of the staff) Solving this system of equations gives you</p>\\n\\n<p>$F_1 = \\\\frac{mg}{2d}(3d-L)$</p>\\n\\n<p>and</p>\\n\\n<p>$F_2 = \\\\frac{mg}{2d}(L-d)$</p>\\n\\n<p>Plugging in the given numbers with a reasonable guess for hand width, I get 770 N (170 lbf), directed downward, for the first force (closer to the end of the staff), and 860 N (190 lbf), directed upward, for the second force. So we\\'re basically talking about the ability to exert 200 lbf with each hand, although you could rely on the structural integrity of your arm to help you out.</p>\\n\\n<p>Notice that, since one of your hands is pulling upward and the other is pushing downward, the <em>net</em> force is 90 N, or 20 lbf, upwards - exactly what is needed to support the weight of the staff.</p>\\n',\n",

       "  'Body': '<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_body\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Blackbody radiation</a> is an idealized description of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">thermal radiation</a> of a substance which is in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_equilibrium\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">thermal equilibrium</a> with the photon field.  Your description in the question, which equates thermal radiation and blackbody radiation is therefore not quite accurate.  Indeed, blackbody radiation is quite simple compared to thermal radiation in general -- blackbody radiation doesn\\'t depend at all on material properties, all it depends on is the temperature and fundamental constants of the electromagnetic field.  Why is this?  Philosophically, when two things are in thermal equilibrium, we can \"set an equals sign\" between many of their properties.  Therefore, when an object is in thermal equilibrium with the field of photons, to understand the radiation it emits, we only need properties arising from the statistical mechanics and spectrum of photons in three dimensions.</p>\\n\\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson%E2%80%93Nyquist_noise\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Johnson noise</a> also is independent of the properties of the material, and as it also has to do with electromagnetic fields, one might expect it to be related to blackbody radiation inside the conductor.  This is indeed the case, but now we must concern ourselves with photons in one dimension, since the typical setting for Johnson noise is in a wire, rather than free space!  This explains the difference in the formulas.  Derivations of Johnson noise in this context can be found <a href=\"http://www.claysturner.com/dsp/Johnson-Nyquist%20Noise.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~phylabs/bsc/LV_Programs/Lab_9/Johnson%20Noise%20Docs/Phys122_Johnson_Noise.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> (just from a google search of \"Johnson noise\" and \"blackbody\").</p>\\n\\n<p>You can read a discussion of how to think about Johnson noise in terms of blackbody radiation in <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20150915113626/http://www.eng.yale.edu/rslab/internal/Papers/dickepaper.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this classic 1946 paper by Robert Dicke</a> titled \"The Measurement of Thermal Radiation at Microwave Frequencies\".  The physical point made there is that an antenna receiving blackbody radiation at temperature $T$ and a resistor at temperature $T$ experiencing Johnson noise must have equal power.  The difference in the forms of the power spectra is apparently due to the frequency dependence of the antenna\\'s detection pattern.</p>\\n',\n",

The mass of the electron has contributions from a cloud of virtual electron-positron pairs (this is an effect called mass renormalization).  </p>\\n\\n<p>This is a bit confusing -- it turns out that e.g. talking about an electron as a single particle that doesn\\'t interact with itself is a classical notion that breaks down when quantum field theory comes into the picture.</p>\\n\\n<p>Indeed, quantum field theories (i.e. the best physical pictures that we currently have) are actually agnostic in a certain strong sense as to whether an electron is a single particle, or a particle surrounded by a cloud, or whether a hole is a true particle or a quasiparticle, etc.   What do I mean by this?  Well, the mathematical models that currently describe the systems best do not talk about particles at all, they talk about excitations in quantum fields, and for interacting quantum fields, it turns out that the coupling constants that go into the Lagrangians for these field theories will get (in general divergent!) corrections from self-interactions.  Luckily, we now understand that this is not something to worry about --  there\\'s a technique called \"renormalization\" which fixes the mathematical divergences, and there\\'s a philosophy of \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_field_theory\">effective field theories</a>\" which explains how to think about these cancellations.  Roughly speaking, depending on what energy scale you want to work in, you might interpret the electron as being a single particle, or a fuzzy cloud, but with regards to calculating measurable quantities, it doesn\\'t really matter.  For a better take on this, I like the first few sections of Howard Georgi\\'s review \"<a href=\"http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~hgeorgi/review.pdf\">Effective field theory</a>\".</p>\\n\\n<p>Sorry if this doesn\\'t make much sense at the moment.

       "  'Body': '<p>I don\\'t really understand exactly what you mean with assumptions, but I guess you ask about the physical nature and behavior of the quantistic world. I am going to be very inaccurate in the following writing, but I need some space to get things understood. What you are going to read is a harsh simplification.</p>\\n\\n<p>The first assumption is the fact that particles at the quantistic level don\\'t have a position, like real-life objects, they don\\'t even have a speed. Well, they sort of have it, but in reality they are \"fuzzy\". Fuzzy in the sense that you cannot really assign a position to them, or a speed. </p>\\n\\n<p>To be fair, you perfectly know a real-world case scenario where you have to give up the concepts of speed and position for an entity. Take a guitar, and pluck a string. Where is the \"vibration\" ? Can you point at one specific point in the string where the \"vibration\" is, or how fast this vibration is traveling. I guess you would say that the vibration is \"on the string\" or \"in the space between one end of the string, and the other hand\". However, there are parts of the string that are vibrating more, and parts that are not vibrating at all, so you could rightfully say that a larger part of the \"vibration\" is in the center of the string, a smaller part is on the lateral parts close to the ends, and no vibration is at the very ends. In some sense, you will experience higher \"presence\" of the vibration in the center.</p>\\n\\n<p>With electrons, it\\'s exactly the same. Think \"electron\" as \"vibration\" in the previous example. Soon, you will realize that you cannot really claim anything about the position of an electron, for the fact that has wave nature. You are forced to see the electron not as a charged ball rolling here and there, but as a diffuse entity totally similar to the concept of \"vibration\". As a result, you cannot say anything about the position of an electron, but you can claim that there are zones in the space where the electron has \"higher presence\" and zones that have \"smaller presence\". These zones are probabilistic in nature, and this probability is directly obtained by a mathematical description called the wavefunction. </p>\\n\\n<p>The wavefunction mainly depends on the external potential, meaning that the presence of charges, such as protons and other electrons, will affect the perceived potential and will have an effect on the probability distribution in space of an electron. </p>\\n\\n<p>A second assumption is the mapping between physical quantities (such as energy, or momentum) and quantistic operators. Take for example the momentum of an everyday object: it is given by its mass times its speed. In the quantistic world, you don\\'t really have the concept of position, hence you don\\'t have the concept of speed, hence you have to reinterpret the whole thing in terms of probability (rememeber the string ?), which means that what you have about a quantistic object is its wavefunction, and you have to extract the information about the momentum from this wavefunction. How do you do it ?</p>\\n\\n<p>Well, there\\'s a dogma in quantum mechanics, that if you apply a magic \"operator\" to the wavefunction, it gives you the quantity you want. There are (simple) rules to generate these operators, and you can apply them to a wavefunction to query the momentum, or the total energy, the kinetic energy and so on.</p>\\n',\n",

       "  'Body': '<p>Here are some ways of looking at it for an absolute beginner.   It is only a start.  It is not the way you will finally look at it, but there is nothing actually incorrect here.</p>\\n\\n<p>First, plain English just won\\'t do, you are going to need some math.  Do you know anything about complex numbers?   If not, learn a little more before you begin.</p>\\n\\n<p>Second, in quantum mechanics, we don\\'t work with probabilities, you know, numbers between 0 and 1 that represent the likelihood of something happening.   Instead we work with the square root of probabilities, called \"probability amplitudes\", which are complex numbers.   When we are done, we convert these back to probabilities.   This is a fundamental change; in a way the complex number amplitudes are just as important as the probabilities.  The logic is therefore different from what you are used to.</p>\\n\\n<p>Third, in quantum mechanics, we don\\'t imagine that we know all about objects in between measurements, rather we know that we don\\'t.   Therefore we only focus on what we can actually measure, and possible results of a particular measurement.   This is because some of the assumed imagined properties of objects in between measurements contradict one another, but we can get a theory where we can always work with the measurements themselves in a consistent way.    Any measurement (meter reading, etc.) or property in between measurements has only a probability amplitude of yielding a given result, and the property only co-arises with the measurement itself.</p>\\n\\n<p>Fourth, if we have several mutually exclusive possibilities, the probability amplitude of either one or the other happening is just the sum of the probability amplitudes of each happening.    Note that this does not mean that the probabilities themselves add, the way we are used to classically.   This is new and different.</p>\\n\\n<p>If we add up the probabilities (not the amplitudes this time but their \"squares\") of all possible mutually exclusive measurements, gotten by \"squaring\" the probability amplitudes of each mutually exclusive possibilities, we always get 1 as usual.   This is called unitarity.</p>\\n\\n<p>This is not the whole picture, but it should help somewhat.\\nAs a reference, try looking at three <a href=\"http://vega.org.uk/video/subseries/8\">videos of some lectures that Feynman once gave at Cornell</a>.   That should help more.</p>\\n',\n",

As long as you\\'re far away from any of the resonant frequencies of the relevant atoms, this picture isn\\'t too bad.</p>\\n\\n<p>You can think each of the atoms as being like a little dipole, consisting of some positive and some negative charge that is driven back and forth by the off-resonant light field. Being an assemblage of charges that are accelerating due to the driving field, these dipoles will radiate, producing waves at the same frequency as the driving field, but slightly out of phase with it (because a dipole being driven at a frequency other than its resonance frequency will be slightly out of phase with the driving field). The total light field in the material will be the sum of the driving light field and the field produced by the oscillating dipoles. If you go through a little bit of math, you find that this gives you a beam in the same direction as the original beam-- the waves going out to the sides will mostly interfere destructively with each other-- with the same frequency but with a slight delay compared to the driving field. This delay registers as a slowing of the speed of the wave passing through the medium. The exact amount of the delay depends on the particulars of the material, such as the exact resonant frequencies of the atoms in question.</p>\\n\\n<p>As long as you\\'re not too close to one of the resonant frequencies, this gives you a really good approximation of the effect (and \"too close\" here is a pretty narrow range).

The basic idea of treating the atoms like little dipoles is a variant of \"Huygens\\'s Principle,\" by the way, which is a general technique for thinking about how waves behave.</p>\\n',\n",

The link has been provided by @user26143 , the copy by @DeerHunter . </p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>Posted on: January 20, 2010 11:13 AM, by Chad Orzel  ( who happens to be a USER here, on Physics.SE).</p>\\n  \\n  <p>1) <strong>Particles are waves, and vice versa</strong>. Quantum physics tells us that every object in the universe has both particle-like and wave-like properties. It\\'s not that everything is really waves, and just sometimes looks like particles, or that everything is made of particles that sometimes fool us into thinking they\\'re waves. Every object in the universe is a new kind of object-- call it a \"quantum particle\" that has some characteristics of both particles and waves, but isn\\'t really either.</p>\\n  \\n  <p>Quantum particles behave like particles, in that they are discrete and (in principle) countable. Matter and energy come in discrete chunks, and whether you\\'re trying to locate an atom or detect a photon of light, you will find it in one place, and one place only.</p>\\n  \\n  <p>Quantum particles also behave like waves, in that they show effects like diffraction and interference. If you send a beam of electrons or a beam of photons through a narrow slit, they will spread out on the far side. If you send the beam at two closely spaced slits, they will produce a pattern of alternating bright and dark spots on the far side of the slits, as if they were water waves passing through both slits at once and interfering on the other side. This is true even though each individual particle is detected at a single location, as a particle.</p>\\n  \\n  <p>2) <strong>Quantum states are discrete</strong>. The \"quantum\" in quantum physics refers to the fact that everything in quantum physics comes in discrete amounts. A beam of light can only contain integer numbers of photons-- 1, 2, 3, 137, but never 1.5 or 22.7. An electron in an atom can only have certain discrete energy values-- -13.6 electron volts, or -3.4 electron volts in hydrogen, but never -7.5 electron volts. No matter what you do, you will only ever detect a quantum system in one of these special allowed states.</p>\\n  \\n  <p>3) <strong>Probability is all we ever know</strong>. When physicists use quantum mechanics to predict the results of an experiment, the only thing they can predict is the probability of detecting each of the possible outcomes. Given an experiment in which an electron will end up in one of two places, we can say that there is a 17% probability of finding it at point A and an 83% probability of finding it at point B, but we can never say for sure that a single given electron will definitely end up at A or definitely end up at B. No matter how careful we are to prepare each electron in exactly the same way, we can never say for definitiviely what the outcome of the experiment will be. Each new electron is a completely new experiment, and the final outcome is random.</p>\\n  \\n  <p>4) <strong>Measurement determines reality</strong>. Until the moment that the exact state of a quantum particle is measured, that state is indeterminate, and in fact can be thought of as spread out over all the possible outcomes. After a measurement is made, the state of the particle is absolutely determined, and all subsequent measurements on that particle will return produce exactly the same outcome.</p>\\n  \\n  <p>This seems impossible to believe-- it\\'s the problem that inspired Erwin Schrödinger\\'s (in)famous thought experiment regarding a cat that is both alive and dead-- but it is worth reiterating that this is absolutely confirmed by experiment. The double-slit experiment mentioned above can be thought of as confirmation of this indeterminacy-- until it is finally measured at a single position on the far side of the slits, an electron exists in a superposition of both possible paths. The interference pattern observed when many electrons are recorded one after another is a direct consequence of the superposition of multiple states.</p>\\n  \\n  <p>The Quantum Zeno Effect is another example of the effects of quantum measurement: making repeated measurements of a quantum system can prevent it from changing its state. Between measurements, the system exists in a superposition of two possible states, with the probability of one increasing and the other decreasing. Each measurements puts the system back into a single definite state, and the evolution has to start over.</p>\\n  \\n  <p>The effects of measurement can be interpreted in a number of different ways-- as the physical \"collapse\" of a wavefunction, as the splitting of the universe into many parallel worlds, etc.-- but the end result is the same in all of them. A quantum particle can and will occupy multiple states right up until the instant that it is measured; after the measurement it is in one and only one state. </p>\\n  \\n  <p>5) <strong>Quantum correlations are non-local</strong>. One of the strangest and most important consequences of quantum mechanics is the idea of \"entanglement.\" When two quantum particles interact in the right way, their states will depend on one another, no matter how far apart they are. You can hold one particle in Princeton and send the other to Paris, and measure them simultaneously, and the outcome of the measurement in Princeton will absolutely and unequivocally determine the outcome of the measurement in Paris, and vice versa.</p>\\n  \\n  <p>The correlation between these states cannot possibly be described by any local theory, in which the particles have definite states. These states are indeterminate until the instant that one is measured, at which time the states of both are absolutely determined, no matter how far apart they are. This has been experimentally confirmed dozens of times over the last thirty years or so, with light and even atoms, and every new experiment has absolutely agreed with the quantum prediction.</p>\\n  \\n  <p>It must be noted that this does not provide a means of sending signals faster than light-- a measurement in Paris will determine the state of a particle in Princeton, but the outcome of each measurement is completely random. There is no way to manipulate the Parisian particle to produce a specifc result in Princeton. The correlation between measurements will only be apparent after the fact, when the two sets of results are compared, and that process has to take place at speeds slower than that of light.</p>\\n  \\n  <p>6) <strong>Everything not forbidden is mandatory</strong>. A quantum particle moving from point A to point B will take absolutely every possible path from A to B, at the same time. This includes paths that involve highly improbable events like electron-positron pairs appearing out of nowhere, and disappearing again. The full theory of quantum electro-dynamics (QED) involves contributions from every possible process, even the ridiculously unlikely ones.</p>\\n  \\n  <p>It\\'s worth emphasizing that this is not some speculative mumbo-jumbo with no real applicability. <strong>A QED prediction of the interaction between an electron and a magnetic field correctly describes the interaction to 14 decimal places.</strong> As weird as the idea seems, it is one of the best-tested theories in the history of science.</p>\\n  \\n  <p>7) <strong>Quantum physics is not magic</strong>. [...] As strange as quantum physics is [...] it does not suspend all the rules of common sense. The bedrock principles of physics are still intact: energy is still conserved, entropy still increases, nothing can move faster than the speed of light. <strong>You cannot exploit quantum effects to build a perpetual motion machine, or to create telepathy or clairvoyance</strong>.</p>\\n  \\n  <p>Quantum mechanics has lots of features that defy our classical intuition-- indeterminate states, probabilitistic measurements, non-local effects-- but it is still subject to the most important rule at all: <strong>If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is</strong>. Anybody trying to peddle a perpetual motion machine or a mystic cure using quantum buzzwords is deluded at best, or a scam artist at worst.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n',\n",

       "  'Body': \"<p>Sure, it's possible. That's how sets of cell phone radio towers work. In a typical setup, several of these towers are placed in a line, some distance outside of a town, such that the line is roughly perpendicular to the direction to the town. The placement of the towers is designed so that the signals reinforce each other as much as possible only in the town. That way, most of the cell towers' transmitted power gets directed toward the area where most people are actually using their cell phones, and you don't waste a whole lot of power by transmitting into open wilderness.</p>\\n\\n<p>With the cell towers, though, the only things that really get pushed around by the EM waves are electrons in people's cell phones. Theoretically, there's no reason the same concept couldn't be used to move something larger, like a magnet, but you'd need <em>vastly</em> more powerful transmitters - perhaps more powerful than anyone knows how to build with current technology (depending on how large of a magnet you're trying to move, and how far away it is). Still, it's just an engineering problem.</p>\\n\\n<p>Also, a side note: it's generally the electric field that's responsible for moving things around, not the magnetic field. Magnetic fields themselves don't transfer energy, they only change the direction of existing motion. But the two kinds of fields mix when you change your reference frame, so it's kind of a semi-arbitrary distinction anyway.</p>\\n\",\n",

       "  'Body': \"<p>I have a question about cosmology. At popular level people explain the time of decoupling of matter and radiation as the moment when temperature falls enough for nuclei and electrons to recombine into atoms. People say that the Universe became &ldquo;transparent&rdquo;. The photon cross section by an electro-neutral system is smaller than Thomson's one, i.e., technically it means that the mean free path became very large or even infinite.</p>\\n\\n<p>However, there is another mechanism for the mean free path to become infinite. It is because during its expansion the universe becomes less dense. Let me explain it by example. Imagine that you are in the forest where the diameter of tree is $a$, and mean distance between trees is $b$. What is the mean diameter of the observed area? It is proportional to $b^{2}/a$, I suppose. Now let's imagine that our forest is in the expanding universe, i.e., $b$ grows (linearly, for example) with time while $a$ remains constant. Then at some moment &ldquo;the diameter of the observed area&rdquo; starts to grow faster than the speed of light, i.e., becomes infinite. </p>\\n\\n<p>It implies that the recombination is not necessary for the decoupling. Did the recombination start earlier than the moment I described above? Or both mechanisms (recombination and density fall) are equally important for the decoupling?</p>\\n\",\n",

The velocity at time $t=0$ is <em>u</em>, but the acceleration <em>a</em> is constant, so that means that <em>before</em> time $t=0$, the velocity was <em>less</em> than <em>u</em> and was accelerating up to <em>u</em>. If you look far enough back in the past, the velocity must have been negative, and so the object would have passed through the point <em>s</em> sometime. Therefore, both solutions are valid.</p>\\n\\n<p>However, when we pose a problem like this, it is usually implicit that we are only interested in what happens starting from $t=0$, unless we specifically mention otherwise.

       "  'Body': '<p>oneat\\'s answer is correct (I would have commented but I think I\\'m going to need more space)</p>\\n\\n<p>Imagine a vector (line) starting at your center of gravity. The line represents all the forces acting on you. When you are standing still, the direction of the line is straight down (gravity is the single force present).</p>\\n\\n<p>To not fall over whens standing still on a bike, you have to keep the point where the line intersects the ground (let\\'s call it point <strong>A</strong>), between the two wheels of the bike. If you don\\'t, you\\'ll start tipping over.</p>\\n\\n<p>When standing still, the only way to affect that point is to move your center of gravity which you do by shifting your weight.</p>\\n\\n<p>Now let\\'s say you\\'re moving. If you\\'re moving in a straight line, at a constant speed, everything is the same, the only force acting on you is gravity. But if you change direction, you get centrifugal force (as oneat correctly pointed out), the same as what you get when you make a sharp turn in a car moving at speed. The value of that force is proportional with your speed, your weight and the speed of the turn.</p>\\n\\n<p>This centrifugal force is added to the gravity, and changes the direction of the resulting force acting on you.</p>\\n\\n<p>Remember point <strong>A</strong>? If you\\'re riding your bike and it starts to lean to the right, point A starts to move to the right and the bikes leans even more, and so on. But, you instinctively know to turn your bike to the right. This causes a centrifugal force, pointing left, to appear). If point <strong>A</strong> is still between your wheels then you\\'re fine.</p>\\n\\n<p>If you\\'re moving slowly, the centrifugal force is small, so you have to take the turn more sharply to compensate. If you\\'re moving fast, you might only need to nudge your bike a little to compensate.</p>\\n\\n<p>It\\'s explained in more detail <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_and_motorcycle_dynamics\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.

These are collective coordinates, each normal mode coordinate being, in general, a linear combination of the coordinates of all the particles in the system. This transforms the three coupled oscillators (which means energy having terms of the form $x_i x_j$) to three uncoupled oscillators (energy only depending on $q_i^2$), each having a different frequency. The trick is actually similar to completing the square in the total energy of the system, to bring it to a $\\\\sum_i \\\\frac{1}{2} m_i \\\\omega_i^2 q_i^2$ form.</p>\\n\\n<p>You can solve exactly for these simple harmonic oscillators and then the general solution are going to be a linear combination of these normal modes. </p>\\n\\n<p>In general, if the particles are allowed to move in all three dimensions, the system should be chaotic. Your initial conditions do restrict the motion in 1D, so this shouldn\\'t be a problem.</p>\\n\\n<p>Also note that solutions (albeit approximate) for these kind of problems exist for even $10^{23}$ particles, for example if you consider the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debye_model\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Debye model</a>, which models the vibration of solids as a lattice of coupled (quantum) harmonic oscillators.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:\\nExpanding on <a href=\"https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/229/hans-stricker\">Hans\\'</a> comment, even you choose to represent your problem in a 2D coordinate system, the initial conditions and motion will restrict it to 1D. </p>\\n\\n<p>To see that, let\\'s consider taking our x axis to be the line joining the three particles and fix the origin of the coordinate system on one of the mass $M$ particles. The initial conditions can be written as follows:</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>$x_1(0) = 0$, $m_1 = M$</p>\\n  \\n  <p>$x_2(0) = L + d$, $m_2 = m$</p>\\n  \\n  <p>$x_3(0) = 2 L$, $m_3 = M$</p>\\n  \\n  <p>$y_1(0) = y_2(0) = y_3(0) = 0$</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>where $d$ is the displacement of particle 2 along the line joining 1 and 3 (the $x$ axis) and $L$ is the natural length of the spring.</p>\\n\\n<p>As initially all particles are at rest, and all forces are along the $x$ axis, the $y$ coordinate of either particle cannot change and the situation remains identical for all subsequent times.</p>\\n\\n<p>Yes, this is an idealised model and in real life you never get the particles to perfectly move in 1 dimension. This is because the general 2D motion of 3 particles connected by springs is chaotic -- a small change in the initial conditions (let\\'s say $y_2 = \\\\epsilon$, which is small) will lead to a large change in the displacements at time $t$. </p>\\n\\n<p>Apparently, there is a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body_problem#Sundman.27s_theorem_for_the_3-body_problem\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">series solution</a> for the three body problem, though I am not sure about the exact assumptions that govern it and if it is applicable to the case of three particles linked by springs free to move in 2D. In the case of all initial velocities zero, this solution wouldn\\'t apply as it \"is convergent for all real t, except initial data which correspond to <em>zero angular momentum</em>\".</p>\\n',\n",

As typically studied in physics, the Potts model (and other such models) are put on periodic graphs (often called \"lattices\" in physics), such as the square lattice graph, triangular lattice graph, etc.  The chromatic and Tutte polynomials show up when you compute the \"partition function\" associated to the model, which is a quantity like a generating function... this paragraph is a bit rough, so I\\'d refer to the other references.  </p>\\n\\n<p>Let me know if you have any questions.

Let\\'s examine this with a simple experiment:</p>\\n\\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZQAVq.png\" alt=\"alt text\"></p>\\n\\n<p>Consider an ideal plane-wave laser beam, beam 1, propagating in the <em>z</em>-direction and striking a screen some distance away. Another beam with exactly the same intensity and wavelength, beam 2, hits the screen at the same point, but from a different angle. Both beams are vertically polarized -- that is to say, their <em>E</em>-vectors point in the <em>x</em>-direction.</p>\\n\\n<p>At the point where these beams hit the screen, you will observe interference fringes, which will go all the way down to zero intensity at their darkest points. This is because the <em>x</em>-polarized components of the electric field interfere with each other. Besides the <em>x</em>-components, there are no <em>y</em> or <em>z</em>-components to interfere.</p>\\n\\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/0kUTT.png\" alt=\"alt text\"></p>\\n\\n<p>Now consider the same situation again, but with both beams horizontally polarized. That is to say, the <em>E</em>-field of each beam points at right angles to the beam\\'s propagation direction, and lies in the <em>yz</em>-plane.</p>\\n\\n<p>However, the polarizations are not the same, even though they are both known as \"<em>p</em>-polarized\". (At least I hope so -- I can never remember which is <em>s</em> and which is <em>p</em>.) Beam 1\\'s <em>E</em>-field points purely in the <em>y</em>-direction, but beam 2\\'s <em>E</em>-field has both a <em>y</em> and a <em>z</em>-component, as I\\'ve drawn on the beam in the illustration.</p>\\n\\n<p>At the point where these beams hit the screen, the <em>y</em>-components of the electric fields interfere, once again producing interference fringes. However, even though both beams\\' amplitudes are the same, the <em>y</em>-components are not equal, so the dark parts of the fringes don\\'t go all the way down to zero intensity.</p>\\n\\n<p>So you see, polarization vectors are polarization vectors, no matter which direction they\\'re coming from. Equally valid, you could define your coordinate axes according to the propagation direction of beam 2, so that beam 1 came in at an angle instead, and still arrive at the same result. Specifically, this means that you don\\'t need to worry about parallel transport. </p>\\n',\n",

So probably you won\\'t buy the idea that this last explanation is the true cause of having the kinetic energy increasing quadratically, although, I think it is much more satisfactory than the first explanation.</p>\\n',\n",

Those random processes cannot be neglected <em>in boundary layers</em> (layers of flow close to bounding surfaces atmosphere-soil, atmpsphere-ocean) because they averagely involve a flux of momentum and heat from the atmosphere to the soil or to the ocean (or viceversa). In geophysics most notable boundary layers are:</p>\\n\\n<p>--> The atmospheric boundary layer, that is the bottom part of the atmosphere, about 1000 m thick, in contact with soil and sea surface.</p>\\n\\n<p>--> The oceanic boundary layer, that is the top layer of the sea, about 10-100 m thick, close to the boundary with the atmosphere.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Hence a climatic large scale model ivolving boundary layers (for example models describing wind driven oceanic circulation) must take into account turbulence <em>average</em> effects: indeed <em>parameterizing</em> small scale phenomena means \"taking their average effects into account\".</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>Conversely, <em>far from the boundary layers</em>, turbulence can be neglected.

Fd is called drag force, and is a force by surface unit. It represents the average friction exerted by the atmosphere on the surface. Cd is called \"drag coefficient\", and can be estimated through experimental observations. Its value can be different in different situations. Drag equation is an empirical relation, and can be deduced by purely dimensional consideretions, like Reynolds number. In particular we can find, using Buckingham theorem, that Cd depends <em>only</em> on Reynolds number.</p>\\n',\n",

       "  'Body': '<p>The problem with this question is that static friction and kinetic friction are not fundamental forces in any way-- they\\'re purely phenomenological names used to explain observed behavior. \"Static friction\" is a term we use to describe the observed fact that it usually takes more force to set an object into motion than it takes to keep it moving once you\\'ve got it started.</p>\\n\\n<p>So, with that in mind, ask yourself how you could measure the relative sizes of static and kinetic friction. If the coefficient of static friction is greater than the coefficient of kinetic friction, this is an easy thing to do: once you overcome the static friction, the frictional force drops. So, you pull on an object with a force sensor, and measure the maximum force required before it gets moving, then once it\\'s in motion, the frictional force decreases, and you measure how much force you need to apply to maintain a constant velocity.</p>\\n\\n<p>What would it mean to have kinetic friction be greater than static friction? Well, it would mean that the force required to <em>keep</em> an object in motion would be greater than the force required to <em>start</em> it in motion. Which would require the force to go <em>up</em> at the instant the object started moving. But that doesn\\'t make any sense, experimentally-- what you would see in that case is just that the force would increase up to the level required to keep the object in motion, as if the coefficients of static and kinetic friction were exactly equal.</p>\\n\\n<p>So, common sense tells us that the coefficient of static friction can never be less than the coefficient of kinetic friction. Having greater kinetic than static friction just doesn\\'t make any sense in terms of the phenomena being described.</p>\\n\\n<p>(As an aside, the static/kinetic coefficient model is actually pretty lousy. It works as a way to set up problems forcing students to deal with the vector nature of forces, and allows some simple qualitative explanations of observed phenomena, but if you have ever tried to devise a lab doing quantitative measurements of friction, it\\'s a mess.)</p>\\n',\n",

       "  'Body': '<p>Yes, it is possible to predict the color of a substance, but it is, in some cases, very complex. </p>\\n\\n<p>The color of a substance is decided at various levels. The most \"trivial\" level is the molecule in gas phase. You have a molecule, all by itself, and when you send some white light on it you provide all the colors of the spectrum. The electronic configuration of the molecule is such that it \"prefers\" specific light frequencies (hence, specific light colors). This preference is due to the electronic transitions between a ground state and an excited state, which is then \"quenched\" as heat. As a consequence, the molecule absorb some colors, thus subtracting them from the white light. What you see is the complementary color. If the molecule absorb blue, you get red. If it absorb yellow, you get violet.</p>\\n\\n<p>Electronic transitions, however, are not the only responsible for absorbing light. A molecule can absorb by excitation of rotation and vibration (meaning that the molecule spins faster, or vibrates more). One case is water. Water appears as transparent, but in reality it\\'s slightly blue. The reason is that you are exciting it vibrationally (to be exact, there\\'s an absorption in the red which is an \"overtone\" of a vibration which actually absorb in the infrared). As a result, a minimal amount of red is subtracted from white light and water ends up being slightly blue.</p>\\n\\n<p>Molecules however are not alone in the universe. They can come close, and eventually have other molecules around, either of the same species, or of other species, such as those of a solvent. No reactions are involved, just the proximity of other molecules, with their protons and electrons. The presence of nearby partners alters the electronic setup of the molecule, and as a consequence, a slight variation of the absorption is produced, leading to a change of color, either as a shift towards blue or red.</p>\\n\\n<p>Then you have anything that can change the structure of the molecule through chemical reaction. Take tea, put some lemon into it. Its color becomes lighter, because you are increasing the acidity of the water, and the colored substances in the tea receive the H+ protons, creating a change in the molecular electronic distribution. The result is a different color. This effect can be dramatic: from blue to red, from transparent to purple. These are the so-called pH indicators.</p>\\n\\n<p>Then you have the crystals. When you have ordered atoms, they can absorb light by virtue of their ordered crystalline structure. Note that the starting atom or molecule, by itself, may absorb nothing in the visible, so it would appear \"transparent\", or white. Nevertheless, it\\'s by virtue of the highly ordered crystalline structure that, in the end, what you handle with your hands absorbs light, and thus has a color. This, at the quantum level, has to do with band structure and Bloch wavefunctions. The same fact explains semiconductors and conductivity of metals. How the atoms (or molecules) are arranged in space, and how many you have makes a difference in the final color. You say gold has gold color, but if you take a small cluster (say, 100) of gold atoms, what you see is red, not gold-colored. As a side note to crystals, you have impurities. Take aluminium oxide, it is transparent. Add some Chromium Iron and Titanium and it becomes Ruby, which is red, or sapphire, which is blue, depending on the crystal structure, and the relative quantities of these impurities.</p>\\n\\n<p>Then you have how the substance is structured at the macroscopic level. Take a smooth platinum electrode. It\\'s platinum color. Make it sponge-like (by making very tiny bubbles and pits) to increase the surface area and it appears black as coal. This is because the light is scattered and absorbed completely, leading to a black color. </p>\\n\\n<p>Potentially, you have additional effects perturbing matter-light interaction. What is the color of a CD ? is it silver ? is it \"rainbow\" ? What about the color of a oil slick on the road in a rainy day ? What about the color of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opal\">opal</a>, or of a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_eye\">tiger eye</a> ?</p>\\n\\n<p>As you see, color is a very particular property, and while you can make an educated guess (in particular through quantum mechanics techniques) it\\'s not always easy to know what color a given substance can have. This is just the tip of the iceberg. You have many other phenomena (such as how much light penetrates into the substance, or what imperfections are present) which affects both the color and the reflective properties of a substance. Ice is transparent, but if it\\'s full of bubbles it\\'s white. Plastic looks like plastic, and metal looks like metal, because how the light is scattered and absorbed changes the way light is reflected back to the viewer. This however, does not affect only color, but the general material texture. Pure spectroscopic color for white, non-polarized light is probably what you are referring to.</p>\\n\\n<p>So to answer directly:</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>What determines the color of a substance?</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>many different things.</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>Does it have something to do with the electrons?</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>Yes, in some cases, electrons are \"excited\", leading to absorption of some light frequencies, but it\\'s not the only factor.</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>And is it possible to predict the color of a substance by looking at the formula?</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>In general, no. But you can, from personal experience, know if a substance is colored or not, and more or less in which part of the spectrum it will absorb. To have a more accurate answer, you need a course in computational chemistry, because you need a program, a computational method, and a good dose of skills to get it out. In any case, the required input is just the xyz coordinates of the atoms and their atomic numbers.</p>\\n',\n",

       "  'Body': '<p>This is a problem in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture_mechanics\">theory of cracks</a>, but let me try to give an intuitive discussion on the level of linear elasticity.</p>\\n\\n<p>Imagine a rectangular sheet of material with two opposite ends (which I\\'ll call East and West) being pulled apart slowly.  The stress in the material due to the tension from the boundary conditions will be symmetric across the North South axis by symmetry, and is intuitively \"spread out\" on the rectangle (though the distribution will not be uniform, of course).  </p>\\n\\n<p>Though I won\\'t do it, this stress distribution can be calculated in linear elasticity theory, as part of the theory of plates.</p>\\n\\n<p>On the other hand, if we cut a notch in say the North edge of the rectangle, the symmetry of the material is broken and we should expect the stress distribution to be asymmetrical as well.  A calculation similar to above (but harder due to the funnier geometry) in linear elasticity will probably show that the stress will become focused near the notch.  The wikipedia article above seems to claim that the stress near a very sharp notch will actually come out infinite!  (That is, linear elasticity theory breaks down)</p>\\n\\n<p>Obviously the actual tearing process goes outside of linear elasticity and into plasticity theory somewhat, but I think what happens can be described as follows.  The high concentration of stress near the notch means that when the material gives, it will begin to tear at the \"corner\" of the notch.  Then this tearing causes the notch to get larger, and weakens more nearby material at that corner, which then becomes torn, etc.  This is a bit like a positive feedback loop.  </p>\\n\\n<p>I can\\'t quite relate it to the question you\\'re asking yet, but I remember it\\'s possible to do some cute dimensional analysis to show that cracks below a certain size in a material tend to shrink, and those above the threshold size tend to grow.</p>\\n\\n<p>Let me just add that the shapes of tears in thin sheets has been a recently popular topic in the field of \"extreme mechanics\" in soft matter physics.  See for instance <a href=\"http://proxy.library.upenn.edu:3532/abstract/PRL/v95/i2/e025502\">this recent article by Audoly, Reis and Roman</a> and citing references.</p>\\n',\n",

That is, the neutrons, being identical fermions, can\\'t all be put in the same state.  So to get them closer and closer together you have to go into higher and higher energy states.

The link posted by Thomas Thernel has much more detail.  One good point to emphasize is that, as you might expect, the density is greater at the center of a neutron star than at its outskirts, so the star won\\'t <em>really</em> be all neutrons... you\\'ll have more neutrons closer to the center, and more ordinary atomic nuclei further out.

       "  'Body': '<p>The wavelength of the microwaves inside your microwave oven is somewhere around 3 cm, or a little more than an inch.  When the oven is on, the microwaves inside its cavity tend to form standing waves.  This means that there are nodes in the electromagnetic waves every 1.5 cm or so, which are places within the oven at which the amplitude of the waves is always zero.  Since the energy of the wave at a given point is proportional to the square of its amplitude, these nodes correspond to points at which the oven is not delivering any energy to the food.</p>\\n\\n<p>As a side note, the existence of the nodes allows for a neat experiment that can be performed to measure the speed of light using marshmallows in a microwave.  See, for example, <a href=\"http://orbitingfrog.com/blog/2008/05/13/measure-the-speed-of-light-using-your-microwave/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this website</a>.  Briefly, the bottom of a microwave oven (without a spinning platter) is covered in marshmallows and the oven is turned on.  Some marshmallows start to melt, while others are unaffected -- corresponding to the locations of the nodes.  Measuring the distance between them can tell you the wavelength of the radiation which, combined with the stated frequency of the oven, lets you calculate an experimental value for the speed of light!</p>\\n\\n<p>The existence of these nodes is the reason that most microwave ovens have a rotating platter: the food gets moved through the nodes, but also through the regions that deliver heating energy to it, and on average all of the food is supposed to heat.  In practice though it does often seem, at least anecdotally, that some parts of the food just receive a higher dose of energy than others.  This can lead to soup that is hot in some spots, and still cold in others -- a problem that can be somewhat alleviated by stirring the soup periodically, encouraging the soup to reach thermodynamic equilibrium more quickly.</p>\\n',\n",

In 2D when we exchange two objects we get a richer symmetry group than in 3D, where we get the permutation group whose eigenvalues $ \\\\pm 1$ correspond to the case of bosons and fermions respectively. However, in 2D this symmetry group is enlarged to the braid group - one can exchange two objects by moving them around such that their worldlines \"braid\" around each other.

In much the same way that any classical binary circuit can be built out of NAND gates along, any quantum circuit can be built out of a set of universal quantum gates.</p>\\n',\n",

But consider the energy in the light entering the front face and leaving the rear face of the lenses - what you want would require there to be more coming out than going in, which violates energy conservation. The extra energy has to come from somewhere.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>This question caused a lot more discussion than I expected. I would like to try to explain my answer a little further, because people seem to have misunderstood me.</p>\\n\\n<p>Let me say first, I want to consider the case of using only lenses and similar devices. In j.c.\\'s answer we have already established that what you ask is possible using amplification, frequency conversion, or thermal imaging -- all of which are used in night vision / image intensification technology. Browsing Wikipedia I found out that some animals have a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapetum_lucidum\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">tapetum lucidum</a>, a reflecting membrane behind the retina which turns around any light that made it through the retina without getting absorbed, allowing it to pass through the retinal cells once more and be absorbed on the rebound. This increases the efficiency of the retina, which is also a way to do what you ask, but I\\'m discounting it since it is not available to us humans without resorting to surgery.</p>\\n\\n<p>Now down to business. We want to create corrective glasses that make your vision brighter, but with no</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>magnifying</li>\\n<li>focusing</li>\\n<li>or distortion.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>This means, considering the following diagram:</p>\\n\\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/77EaW.png\" alt=\"a wavefront entering a mystery &quot;?&quot; box and emerging the same\"></p>\\n\\n<p>The optical system we want to create is represented by the \"?\" box. The wavefront on the left has to be the same as the wavefront on the right, only brighter. (Except for the effects of propagation across the distance that the box occupies, but let\\'s ignore that.) Notice that I have drawn the wavefronts as squiggly lines with arrows all over them. This is because the images that our eyes observe are not the same as the point sources we deal with in undergraduate optics, they are made up of many different rays traveling in different directions and with different phases (i.e. running a little ahead of or behind each other.) So it\\'s not enough to just capture \"more light\" into the system, it has to be in the right place, traveling at the proper angle, with the right amount of delay compared to the other rays.</p>\\n\\n<p>Now look at my crude drawing of an eye looking at a triangle:</p>\\n\\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/YbT6L.jpg\" alt=\"an eye regarding a triangle, with some light rays from the triangle entering the eye and some missing it\"></p>\\n\\n<p>I have drawn the outermost rays of the outermost points of the triangle that enter the eye. I have also drawn some rays that go off in different directions that don\\'t enter the eye. To make the image brighter, you would have to ensure that more of the rays that diverge from a single point on the triangle, also converge on the same point on the retina. But how? If the eye\\'s iris and lens were infinitely large, then they would naturally converge there. But we don\\'t have huge eyes, so we would have to use external lenses to achieve that. There is no way, though, to build a system of lenses that does that, without changing the rays that are already on the right track. You can\\'t refract some of the rays and not others.</p>\\n\\n<p>So what I definitely want to make clear is that the idea of \"if the glasses can capture more light, then it will brighten the image\" is a partial misconception. I say \\'partial\\' because what coneslayer says is true: binoculars with a bigger aperture will produce a brighter image. However, this is only true if the brightness was already reduced due to a smaller aperture! Think of it this way: the <em>absence</em> of binoculars is equivalent to 1x binoculars with an infinitely large aperture!</p>\\n\\n<p>Ultimately, the brightness of the image on your retina is limited by the natural aperture of your eye: your pupil. This is why your pupils get bigger in the dark. And you can\\'t make your pupils any bigger than you already do instinctively, at least not without resorting to surgery.</p>\\n\\n<p>By the way, I would like to thank everyone who contributed here for making it such a lively discussion. This forced me to think more carefully about the problem than I did at first, and get all my arguments in order.</p>\\n',\n",

       "  'Body': '<p>(Edited to reflect updated question).</p>\\n\\n<p>The solution has a single parameter, which we can take to be the angle the impacting particle goes after the collision.  A particular solution is determined only after this parameter is given.  Usually we would talk about the collision of, for example, two spheres, in which case this parameter could be related to whether the spheres are  colliding head on or glancing.</p>\\n\\n<p>For example, in the frame where one particle is initially moving and the other is not, one solution is for the moving particle to come to a halt and for the stationary particle to take up all its motion.  Another solution is for both particles to fly off from the impact site at 45 degree angles to the original motion, each with $\\\\sqrt{2}/2$ the initial velocity.  Both of these scenarios conserve momentum and kinetic energy.  </p>\\n\\n<p>There are many other solutions.  In this frame, the conservation of momentum says</p>\\n\\n<p>$\\\\vec{p} = \\\\vec{p_1} + \\\\vec{p_2}$</p>\\n\\n<p>with $\\\\vec{p}$ the momentum before the collision and $\\\\vec{p_1}$ and $\\\\vec{p_2}$ the momenta after.

However, any one particle can choose any angle within 90 degrees of the initial direction of motion to go after the collision.  Once this direction is chosen, the direction of motion of the other particle, as well as their momenta, are fixed.</p>\\n',\n",

       "  'Body': '<p>The obvious answer is their mass, accelerating a subatomic particle to relativistic velocity takes many orders of magnitude less energy than accelerating a macroscopic particle.</p>\\n\\n<p>More subtly, we can only accelerate subatomic particles that we can manipulate with electromagnetic fields, nobody has a proposed viable experiments to study relativistic neutron or neutrino reactions because we really have no way to manipulate them. What this means is that we need relatively light, charged, particles that we can accelerate to relativistic velocity in a reasonable space with reasonable amount of energy.</p>\\n\\n<p>Which brings us to our next point. Modern accelerators use what are called \"RF cavities\" to accelerate charged particles like protons and electrons, these are effectively giant pulsed capacitors with the particle flying in the space between the plates. We are governed by material science and the permiativity of the vacuum and have a limit to the maxium voltage we can put across the plates, and hence the maximum energy we can impart to a particle per unit length of the cavity. For modern accelerators this is on the order of 1 MeV per cm. 1 MeV on an electron goes a long way (which is why your TV works). 1 MeV on a baseball barely does anything. If the LHC seems big, an accelerator to collide two baseballs with the same velocity would be wider than the solar system (using modern technology). </p>\\n\\n<p>More realistically though, we accelerate particles so we can study the physics during collisions of two particles. When we collide electrons and positrons for instance, nearly 100% of the energy carried by the particle is deposited into the reaction if they collide head on, its this fact that lets us see the creation of new and exotic particles following the collision (And why LEP began seeing Z bosons as soon as they crossed the 180GeV threshold). When we move to the LHC for example, we are colliding two protons- which, roughly speaking are sacks of consisting of 3 quarks. And the momentum (and therefore the energy) of the proton is more or less evenly distributed among the three quarks. So the energy available to us in the collision is actually about 6 times less than an eqiuivalent electron-positron collider. Imagine doing this with a baseball, which is composed of trillions of trillions of particles. The energy that each particle carries is a tiny fraction of the total energy of the baseball, therefore every single collision event only has a tiny fraction of the total energy of the system, and in the end we get no useful reaction out of a collision that could not have just as easily been accomplished by putting two televisions face to face.</p>\\n',\n",

As ptomato noted it is an active device, therefore in needs a power source to feed it. But I don\\'t think your are concerned about this.</p>\\n',\n",

       "  'Body': '<p>I\\'m assuming from the phrasing of the question that you would like to see a spatial interference pattern-- bright and dark fringes-- not something in the time domain. As noted earlier, you can easily beat two independent lasers together and get a signal that pulses at the difference between the two. You can also do coincidence counting experiments using photons derived from two different lasers and show that they interfere with each other-- I believe that\\'s the \"Hong-Ou-Mandel\" experiment, but I could have the name wrong.</p>\\n\\n<p>If what you want to see is a pattern of interference fringes in space, you need a detector that is both fast and position-sensitive, as the interference pattern will shift around rapidly in time. You would need to take a \"snapshot\" of the pattern at some instant, before it has time to shift position and wash out the fringes from an earlier time. So, what kind of speed are we talking about?</p>\\n\\n<p>Well, the pattern between the lasers would be steady for a time on the order of the coherence time of the lasers. A good rule of thumb for finding the coherence time for a fairly ordinary laser is that the coherence length of the laser is roughly equal to the length of the cavity. A typical gas laser of the sort you would readily find on the shelves of your local physics department stockroom has a cavity that is roughly one foot long, which means a coherence time of the time required for light to travel one foot, which is one nanosecond.</p>\\n\\n<p>So, you would want to be able to pick up the pattern in less than a nanosecond, which means your detector needs to be able to handle count rates of at least one gigahertz. That\\'s not too difficult to manage-- you can get photodiodes with a bandwidth of 50-60GHz pretty easily. In order to see a spatial pattern, though, you really want a linear array of these at the very least, and a CCD camera would be even better. You also need to be able to pick up multiple photons in that span, in order to be able to see the pattern, so you can clearly resolve the difference between bright and dark fringes-- I would say you probably want at least 100 photons/pixel in the bright fringes to be able to get decent fringe contrast. This is doable with fairly basic lasers-- a few milliwatts in the red range of wavelengths is about 10^15 photons/s, or about 10^6 photons/ns, so you can spread that out over a few thousand pixels and still be safe. And, of course, you need a low level of \"dark counts\" in your detector, so it can readily tell the difference between a bright spot with 100 photons and a dark spot with none.</p>\\n\\n<p>That\\'s a pretty challenging set of detector requirements. You want, essentially, a CCD detector with single-photon sensitivity and a bandwidth of 100 GHz. I don\\'t think you\\'re going to find that just lying around. Even the fast CCD detectors people use for real-time monitoring of BEC experiments and the like have a frame readout time of a millisecond or so, and those aren\\'t single-photon sensitive. Single-photon detectors tend to be single avalanche photodiodes, which are easily damaged by photon count rates of a few tens of kilohertz. You might be able to construct a detector with these specs, but it would be an extremely difficult problem, and not something that would be worth doing just to see a spatial interference pattern between two independent lasers.</p>\\n\\n<p>If you can bump the coherent time of the lasers up by a factor of 1000 (which is not a trivial undertaking) then it becomes a little easier to do, but it\\'s still very difficult-- you\\'re looking for a CCD with a frame readout time of a microsecond or so, able to handle photon counts in the megahertz range. Which is still a very hard problem.</p>\\n\\n<p>Which is probably why it hasn\\'t been done, at least not that I\\'m aware of.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> The closest to the sort of thing you\\'re talking about is the <a href=\"http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PR/v159/i5/p1084_1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pfleegor-Mandel experiment</a>, which used a statistical technique to show that there were spatial fringes in the interference pattern of two independent lasers. It\\'s a long way from a direct observation of the pattern, though.</p>\\n',\n",

There you probe with a electromagnetic wave by causing the voltage in a wire to your sample to oscillate, and you measure the response in the form of electron current.

Many, if not most things studied in physics are <strong>waves</strong> of some sort, and thus scattering processes are very relevant to experiments.  One prominent non-example is most of astrophysics, where we have no chance of actually probing the stars ourselves and can only observe what they do on their own.

Let the molecule be in rest initially. Let all three particles have equal mass $m$.</p>\\n\\n<p>After the collision took place the bullet will move to the right with velocity $v_b$, the molecule will move to the left with velocity $v_m$ and oscillate with frequency $\\\\omega$ and amplitude $\\\\alpha$.</p>\\n\\n<p>The total energy of the molecule and its total momentum after the collision are then (I hope I didn\\'t make any serious errors):</p>\\n\\n<p>$E = \\\\frac{m}{2}(v_1^2 + v_2^2) = m (v_m^2 + \\\\alpha^2\\\\omega^2)$</p>\\n\\n<p>$p = 2mv_m$</p>\\n\\n<p>The conservation laws yield:</p>\\n\\n<p>$v_m = \\\\frac{1}{3}(v_0 + \\\\sqrt{v_0^2 - 3\\\\alpha^2\\\\omega^2})$</p>\\n\\n<p>$v_b = v_0 - 2v_m$</p>\\n\\n<p>Since we know that $v_m \\\\geq \\\\frac{1}{2}v_0$ we get</p>\\n\\n<p>$0 \\\\leq \\\\alpha \\\\leq \\\\frac{v_0}{2\\\\omega}$</p>\\n\\n<p>I.e., the range in which the amplitude $\\\\alpha$ can vary depends on the spring constant $k$ (which is associated with the frequency by $\\\\omega \\\\propto \\\\sqrt{k/m}$): if the spring constant tends to $\\\\infty$ the amplitude must tend to 0 and the molecule must behave approximately like a rigid rod of mass $2m$, as would have been expected.</p>\\n\\n<p>In any case, the amplitude $\\\\alpha$ is <em>not</em> determined by the conservation laws, only its range of possible values. (This is analoguous to the case of two colliding point-like particles, see answers to <a href=\"https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/614/where-do-particles-go-after-collision\">Where do particles go after collision?</a>)</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>But:</strong> At least I would see it as unphysical if the molecule would <em>not</em> oscillate after the collision for finite spring constants $k&gt;0$, which is nevertheless allowed by the conservation laws. I cannot imagine an \"inner structure\" or a micro-process taking place during the collision which would produce this behaviour. What results could inverse scattering experiments yield?</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>How am I to think about this mind-boggling\\n  puzzle?</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p><strong>[Postscript]</strong> In the case of two colliding point-like particles it is easy to specify the dynamics in a most natural way, at least in the case when the two collide with diametrical velocities: \"for symmetry reasons\" their velocities after the collision shall be in the same/opposite direction. (For real point-like particles without inner structure that\\'s the only law/rule that makes sense.)</p>\\n\\n<p>But now the puzzle continues: Which \"natural\" law could determine the solution of the molecule-bullet-problem?</p>\\n',\n",

If I\\'m buying binoculars, I might choose from 8x24, 8x36, or 8x50 binoculars. The first number is the magnification; 8x for all the examples.

Hence, that extra variables have to be added to complete it, contrary to what Cedric claims. The goal of EPR is to show that either nature is non-local (and thus in conflict with SR) either quantum mechanics is incomplete. Since Einstein was not ready to abandon locality and SR, he concluded that quantum mechanics is incomplete.</p>\\n\\n<p>Later however, John Bell would show that quantum mechanics is in fact non-local. To do that, he first devised an inequality that would have to be satisfied by any local physical theory. Then, he showed that this inequality is violated for certain entangled states, thereby proving that quantum mechanics is non-local. In the 70's Alain Aspect then made an experiment to check if Bell's inequalities were violated in nature or not. There have been many similar experiments since then and they all point to nature being non-local and quantum mechanics being a good description of this non-locality.</p>\\n\\n<p>Now, there are possible loopholes in the experiments, which I won't discuss here. </p>\\n\\n<p>One can also object that quantum mechanics described by Schrödinger's equation is not Lorentz-invariant, so we should not expect quantum mechanics to agree with SR.</p>\\n\\n<p>What about equations which are Lorentz-invariant? Dirac equations, Klein-Gordon, etc... That's where it gets difficult. We know that a correct description of these equations requires quantum field theories.

So I don't know of any detailed study within the context of quantum field theory of entanglement and Bell inequalities. But I hope someone can come in with more information about these.

       "  'Body': '<p>Most proton-proton collisions will be elastic: throw in two protons and two protons will come out, deflected at some angle. But the more interesting collisions are those where individual constituents of the proton (quarks, antiquarks, or gluons) interact. For instance, all the interesting high-energy proton-proton collisions at the LHC are really collisions of two quarks, or two gluons, or a gluon and a quark (or similar combinations involving antiquarks) coming from the two protons. The results of this \"hard\" collision often come out at a large angle away from the proton beam, while the \"remnants\" of the proton that weren\\'t directly involved in the collision sail off down the beamline in roughly the same direction the proton was originally going. It\\'s probably reasonable to say that the original proton was \"destroyed\" in this process, although some large fraction of its energy and its constituents keep moving in the same direction.</p>\\n\\n<p>Of course, the word \"destroyed\" is a little fuzzy. The protons don\\'t just disappear. There are a few constraints on the final result of the collision process: it must conserve momentum, energy, and baryon number. A proton has baryon number +1, as does a neutron and various heavier \"hyperons,\" whereas an antiproton has baryon number -1. The momentum, energy, and baryon number can all be divided up in complicated ways. So you might argue that there\\'s a sense in which you didn\\'t \"destroy\" the protons, since at the end you still have to have a total of 2 baryons. But in general, the proton remnants moving down the beamline <em>could</em> join up with antiquarks and make mesons with no net baryon number, while baryons could form from the hard collision and move away at a large angle. In that case I wouldn\\'t say there\\'s any sense in which the original protons maintained their \"identity,\" and I think it would be reasonable to say they were destroyed.</p>\\n\\n<p>All things considered, though, it\\'s probably best to not think in terms of the word \"destroy\" that you chose at all. Maybe the way to visualize it is like this: most proton-proton collisions are like two billiard balls that bounce off each other in an elastic way. But the collisions that are of the most interest at a collider are more like cases where two billiard balls hit each other and small pieces of each shear off and fly out at a big angle, but the bulk of each ball keeps moving in roughly the direction it started from.</p>\\n',\n",

It has to do with the strange nature of torque and its interaction with angular momentum. When a force acts on a spinning top, it excerpts a torque perpendicular to the plane defined by the axis of the top and the direction of gravity, which is a vertical plane. That direction is horizontal. \\nOn the other hand, the torque is the rate of change of angular momentum. That means that the direction of the torque is the direction towards which the vector of angular momentum changes. Thus, since the torque is horizontal and perpendicular to the angular momentum, it can only change the direction of angular momentum along the horizontal direction and not towards the ground. That means that the vector of angular momentum has its back on the ground, at the point that the tip of the top touches the ground, and its head is performing a circle on a plane that is parallel to the ground.

       "  'Body': '<p>The answer to the question depends a bit on what is meant by \"mediated\". A composite quantum system composed of two or more quantum subsystems can be in a quantum state in which the subsystems are entangled from the beginning, i.e., from the initial state. If the composite system evolves without any interaction among the subsystems, then the form and degree of entanglement between them will not change. If there is interaction, the entanglement will, usually, change in form and/or degree. In particular, if the initial state is not entangled, then subsequent interaction between the subsystems will entangle them. But this fact, per se, doesn\\'t depend on the kind of interaction. Any interaction, whatsoever, between the subsystems will, at least for awhile, entangle the initially non-entangled subsystems. One might well regard this as \"mediation\" of entanglement by interaction. But physicists, generally, do not think of entanglement, per se, as a dynamical feature of quantum mechanics. Rather, it is regarded as a kinematical/structural possibility of quantum states for composite systems which can be modified by the presence of interactions but is not ultimately, due to interactions.</p>\\n\\n<p>Let me add that entangled states are the most common states, by far. The unentangled states of composite systems (which are just the so-called product states) are much rarer by comparison.     </p>\\n',\n",

This is a higher energy state than a simple spherical blog, a Gaussian.   Given the range of internuclear forces, this nodal antisymmetric wavefunction has more energy than if the two nucleons just stayed apart. This is a matter of radial or angular kinetic energy has to be either \"zero\" or some quantized value that exceeds \"escape velocity\"  So forget that part of the system wavefunction being antisymmetric.  </p>\\n\\n<p>BTW, we don\\'t have separate spatial wavefunctions for the two nucleons - whatever one does, the partner does the exact opposite, like a two-body celestial mechanics problem.  They orbit a common barycenter.  </p>\\n\\n<p>The spin part could be antisymmetric.  This is a bit tricky.  If particle #1 is up and #2 is down, we can write \"UD\".  There is also \"DU\".  We form the spin part of the wavefunction for the pair as UD-DU.  We could instead choose UD+DU but note this is symmetric. So are UU and DD.  Just how UD-DU differs from UD+DU may mystify beginners in quantum mechanics, but it\\'s important, and it\\'s how physical matter works whether we humans like it or not.  (You might also see where the \\'u\\' and \\'d\\' quarks got their names.  The quark idea came along years after isospin.)</p>\\n\\n<p>Neither D nor U is really a wave or a function; they\\'re at most just rows and columns in matrices if you must represent them in familiar math.  Otherwise quantum physicists just deal with these symbolically.  Still the jargon is \"wavefunction\" - we silly humans and our primitive scientific language!</p>\\n\\n<p>The same math applies for isospin.   But the physics differs.   We\\'ve concluded that the spatial part of the system wavefunction must be symmetric, so it\\'s up to either the spin part or the isospin part to be antisymmetric.  But not both!   If spins are symmetric - they\\'re parallel.  This is experimentally the case - the Deuteron (obtain by distilling \"heavy water\" from water) - so we deduce that the isospin part is antisymmetric.  That is, we must have one isospin \"up\" and one isospin \"down\" - neutron and a proton, not two neutrons or two protons.   </p>\\n\\n<p>Just why must the spins of the two nucleons be parallel?  The strong force holding them together - the exchange of pions, kaons and other mesons - works better in that case.  To explain that takes deeper analysis than I can go into here.   When the spins are antiparallel, there\\'s not enough force to keep the nucleons together.  </p>\\n\\n<p>This would be the case though, were to try pushing two neutrons together.  They\\'d be both isospin \"up\" therefore symmetric isospin part of the wavefunction, therefore requiring an antisymmetric spin part, which leads to the pions and their buddies not getting as good a grip on the neutrons, which drift off going their separate ways.</p>\\n',\n",

In this sense, Newtonian gravity is an \"effective description\" of GR (in the appropriate energy scale).</p>\\n\\n<p>The same is true for Quantum Field Theories: you can start with a given description at a given energy (or length) scale and, as you change your scale, either increasing or decreasing the energy of the phenomena involved, you\\'ll be lead to different theories, in order to describe the new, effective, phenomena that you\\'ll see. For instance, you can describe the world in terms of protons and neutrons or in terms of quarks and gluons —\\xa0the only change is in the energy scale used and, as such, in the \"effective theory\" you\\'ll be using to describe the ingredients your experiments measure.</p>\\n\\n<p>These are the concepts really behind Anderson\\'s argument.

Here\\'s a picture: you can describe a proton in terms of quarks and gluons, but it\\'s very hard to describe a whole nucleus in terms of quarks and gluons — essentially because there are so many of them, that calculations become virtually impossible. So, what people do is to compute the Effective Field Theory of quarks and gluons, and use it instead to describe the whole nucleus.</p>\\n\\n<p>A similar thing can be seen in Statistical Mechanics, when one observes that the behavior of  a collection of particles is very different from that of a single particle —\\xa0this is the prototypical \"more is different\": the physical properties of the collection of particles are not mirrored by the individual properties of each particle — this is \"emergence\", and that\\'s why we use Effective Field Theories to describe the collection of particles.</p>\\n\\n<p>What\\'s really astounding is that, using Renormalization Group techniques, we can actually compute Effective Field Theories for several different energy scales! 8-)</p>\\n',\n",

I really doubt that any working physicists really hold the former position anymore, in part due to one of the great advances of post 1950\\'s theoretical physics, the effective field theory and renormalization group philosophy that Daniel so nicely explained in his answer.  We don\\'t have to go that deep to see some illustrations of this though.</p>\\n\\n<h3>examples</h3>\\n\\n<p>Let me give some easy examples and raise some discussion questions to help you decide what qualifies as a physical law.</p>\\n\\n<p>Probably the first emergent insight that one learns in physics is the notion of \"center of mass\", that is, the idea that in many cases you can treat an object made out of $10^{27}$ atoms as a single point particle!  Though it\\'s not pointed out when you\\'re a freshman, what\\'s going on here is exactly the same as happens in all other applications of emergence - you ignore all the internal degrees of freedom of your sliding block, for instance, because they are much higher energy than the stuff that you want to talk about.  Does the fact that we ignore all that information make the explanation of the acceleration of a block any less of a \"physical law\"?  </p>\\n\\n<p>Already we see a generic fact about emergence -- at some point the explanation breaks down.  For instance, there\\'s no way from treating a block as a point particle to be able to understand the sound it makes when it hits the ground, though we can get a very good description of its motion (in a vacuum, say)!</p>\\n\\n<p>Two discoveries at the start of the 20th century showed that the entire edifice of Newton\\'s laws and Galilean relativity is an emergent phenomenon.  Note that this understanding doesn\\'t invalidate most applications of Newton\\'s laws -- that the limit $c\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty$ and $\\\\hbar\\\\rightarrow0$ simplifies to something that high school students can calculate with is really amazing, isn\\'t it?  But, does the fact that they are \"just\" some limiting case mean that Newton\\'s laws and Galilean relativity are not \"physical laws\"?  </p>\\n\\n<p>We can also turn these questions around and imagine ourselves in a universe where QM and SR were discovered first.  In that case, if people then discovered the classical limits, would people think of them as less \"physical\"?  </p>\\n\\n<h3>conclusion</h3>\\n\\n<p>One could and should spend some time thinking about what our physical principles are and what \"emergent\" assumptions and approximations go into them; breaking down the assumption that mechanics ended with Newton was the work of the 1st half of the 20th century.  On the other hand, Anderson points out that it\\'s also useful to go in the opposite direction, in some ways, this is where the big problems in physics that I\\'m interested in are; to start with many-body descriptions which are impossible to calculate with and not very illuminating, and pick out the simplifications and insights that emerge!  Whether you call it a physical law or not is sort of besides the point, right?</p>\\n\\n<p>These are some of the things that come up when I think a bit about your question.  </p>\\n',\n",

I\\'m trying to understand exactly how it works.</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>An Elmore-Tuck-Watson fusor ... consists of a vacuum chamber containing a negatively charged outer grid (which may be the chamber) and a positively charged inner grid. Electrons are injected into the system and accelerated toward the inner grid. Most of the time, the electrons pass through the grid, through the core, and through the inner grid again, which then decelerates them and reaccelerates them inward wherein they return through the core. As they pass repeatedly through the core, they generate a negatively charged zone, a potential well, which is called a virtual cathode.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> So this device uses a constant high voltage applied to the electrodes to produce a region of negative electric charge in the center.  How is this possible?  Electrons repel each other, so creating a region in empty space in which electrons are more dense than their surroundings would seem to require a constant energy input.  Without any energy input, they\\'ll just fly apart to a minimum energy equilibrium where the charge density is equal everywhere.  Applying a voltage to electrodes with no current flowing between them does not use up any energy, however.  So where is the energy to hold the clump of electrons together coming from?</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>Like the Elmore-Tuck-Watson (ETW) fusor, the polywell confines positive ions through their attraction to the negative potential well which is created by the electrons that are held inside a positively charged grid. However, to avoid the losses related to the electrons striking the grid, the Polywell uses magnetic fields to shield the grid. The magnetic fields are configured in a way that adds to the confinement of the electrons so that there are many more electrons inside the core than outside.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p><strong>Question 2:</strong> So the magnetic fields generated by the grid would supposedly prevent the electrons from hitting the grid.  The positively charged inner grid is attractive to electrons, but it\\'s also magnetized, and somehow the magnetic fields repel electrons away from the grid?  But how can unchanging/steady-state magnets confine (or repel) electrons?  A bar magnet doesn\\'t create any kind of movement or displacement of charge.</p>\\n',\n",

The moral is the same here: divergences arise because our picture is only effective and, more generally, the theory doesn't account for all the realistic effects of the nature (like measurement).</p>\\n\\n<p>The UV divergences appear because of infinite interaction energies and they point at the fact that the theory might be incomplete (i.e. it's just an approximation of some better underlying theory), so we are not really allowed to take infinite energy limit without somehow modifying our theory to accommodate for this.</p>\\n\\n<p>What about IR divergence? Well, this limit again cannot be taken if you think about it a little but the reason is different from the UV case. IR limit lets you count with arbitrarily small energies.

       "  'Body': '<ol>\\n<li><p>Not really sure about this question. Are you perhaps just asking about notation? You can choose whatever you like. But usually you choose one coordinate system and just work in that. It\\'s certainly a non-issue if you are working in flat spacetime: there you have nice global coordinates for everything.</p></li>\\n<li><ul>\\n<li><p>First sentence is correct. For arbitrary Lie group $G$ with Lie algebra $\\\\mathfrak{g}$ you might get a so called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-structure\" rel=\"nofollow\">G-structure</a> (e.g. $O(n)$-structure for Riemannian manifolds) and you can define a connection on that. It\\'s rather heavy-duty mathematics, but at the end of the day you obtain a $\\\\mathfrak{g} $-valued (more precisely, it takes values in the adjoint representation of $\\\\mathfrak{g} $) one-form $ \\\\omega $ and covariant derivative $D_{\\\\mu}$ such as the one you\\'ve written.</p></li>\\n<li><p>In general I visualize connections like this: you put in a vector and the connection gives you back an element of the Lie algebra that is a generator of some transformation in the Lie group. E.g. on a Riemannian manifold you insert into the connection the direction you want to go to and you\\'ll get back (very roughly said) information on how much the space is curved in that direction. More preciselly, if you integrate $\\\\oint_{\\\\gamma} \\\\exp(\\\\omega(\\\\dot{\\\\gamma}(t))) dt$ you obtain some element $T \\\\in G$ that tells you how any vector gets parallel-transported along the closed curve $\\\\gamma$ (this is called holonomy).</p></li>\\n<li><p>As for the last question of why $ U(1) $: well, because it\\'s electromagnetism. Various groups will give you various interactions (e.g. $SU(3)$ gives you QCD). These groups arise because the theories contain something called gauge symmetry. I am sure you know that Maxwell equations, when written out in $A$ and $\\\\phi$, are invariant to certain transformations. More concretely and clearly, as ${\\\\bf F} = d{\\\\bf A}$, where ${\\\\bf F}$ is the electromagnetic tensor and ${\\\\bf A} $ is the four-potential. In this form it\\'s obvious that equations for $ {\\\\bf F}$ don\\'t change upon the transformation ${\\\\bf A&#39;} = {\\\\bf A} + d\\\\chi$. Now, let us step back to $\\\\psi$ and note that if you want to make the theory locally invariant (why would you do that? because it\\'s nice to have local properties instead of global ones. And the theory is clearly invariant with respect to global phase change, so let\\'s just try this) with respect to the change of phase, you\\'ll have to introduce new degree of freedom ${\\\\bf A}$ that transforms precisely like the four-potential in Maxwell theory! Actually, what we just did is that we recovered photons. So, to conclude: if you choose $ U(1)$ as a group of symmetries, electromagnetism pops out. But note that to incorporate all of this consistently, you need to work in the framework of quantum field theory because Schrödinger\\'s equation clearly isn\\'t relativistically invariant, which is a feature we\\'d surely like to have in the theory of electromagnetism.</p></li>\\n</ul></li>\\n<li><p>This can be a little confusing, especially in the physical literature and I doubt I can really make it clearer. Probably this will just confuse you even more but here goes: there exist various spaces of sections and $ G$-structures and representations of both $ G $ and $ \\\\mathfrak{g}$ that one should really discern between but which are identified in physics. To make this rigorous would take too much space, so I suggest you look at some books on gauge theory. I\\'ll just tell you that vector (more precisely vector <em>field</em>) is also a section and vice-versa. But note that another two terms are getting mixed together here: abstract vector as a concept from linear algebra (this is our $ \\\\psi $: you know it\\'s this kind of vector because it has no spacetime index $\\\\mu $) and vector as an element of Minkowski spacetime, say $V^{\\\\mu}$. As for the $ D_{\\\\mu} $, it acts (by extension) also on tensor algebra of the space of sections $ \\\\psi $ (in this simple case where $\\\\psi $ has no index, the tensor algebra is isomorphic to normal tangent tensor algebra) and gives you a one-form living in this tensor algebra, so yeah: it is a section, but in a totally different (altough isomorphic) space!</p></li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<p>No need to apologize. These things are pretty hard and it takes a lot of time to grok all of it and I guess lot of the physicists would just hand-wave most of the mathematical content away and go ahead to calculate something. Which is possible here because $ U(1) $ is only one-dimensional, its Lie algebra is one-dimensional, and so is $ \\\\psi  $. So you just work with numbers all the time and there arises no need for abstract concepts. Except that this doesn\\'t help you one bit when you\\'ll try to generalize this (either to QCD with non-abelian group $ SU(3) $, or to the curved spacetime), or even if you try to think about some concepts that are rather basic from the point of view of geometry (e.g. try thinking about what is the meaning of the above-mentioned holonomy with respect to $\\\\gamma $ in the case of $ U(1 )  $). So it\\'s good you\\'re trying to understand the core principles already.</p>\\n\\n<hr>\\n\\n<p><strong>Update</strong> in regard to Greg\\'s question in the comments:</p>\\n\\n<p>I am not sure I understand you completely but I got a feeling (probably wrong) that you are mixing up various notions of invariance here. There are at least two notions of physical invariance (under the action of Lorentz group and under the action of $U(1)$) and also a notion of invariance in the sense of being \"coordinate-free\". Now, if my feeling is correct, you are asking for an analogue of $v = v^{\\\\mu}{{\\\\rm \\\\partial} \\\\over {\\\\rm \\\\partial} x^{\\\\mu}}$ for $\\\\psi$. These two things are indeed very similar, but in a little disguised way. More precisely: $v$ is a section of a tangent bundle $TM$ and we are decomposing it with respect to some section of the canonical tangent frame bundle $FM$, which also carries a natural action of the group $GL_k({\\\\mathbb{R}})$ (the action is a local change of basis and $k$ is the rank of $TM$). In other words, we have a $G$-structure here and this is where \"coordinate-free\" invariance comes from. The situation is similar with $\\\\psi$: it is a section of a vector bundle $\\\\pi: V \\\\to M$ which carries an $U(1)$-structure. At this point it should also be clear where the difference between the two cases is: in the former you have two bundles $TM$ and $FM$ while in the latter there is only $\\\\pi: V \\\\to M$. So it doesn\\'t really make sense to ask for $\\\\psi$ to be any more invariant than it already is: you have nothing with respect to which you could decompose it. So instead of thinking about $\\\\psi$ as an analogue of section of $TM$, think of it instead as an analogue of a section of $FM$.</p>\\n',\n",

       "  'Body': '<p>Here\\'s a short(-ish) answer.  A vector bundle is a family of vector spaces over a manifold.  The vector spaces can have bases.  The manifold can have coordinates.  The two concepts are not a priori related (now for the bundle of <em>tangent</em> spaces, a coordinate change happens to induce a change of basis; this fact often sows confusion).  Once you pick a basis for your vector space, you <em>do</em> define a vector by its components -- but someone else may be describing the <em>same</em> vector in a different basis.  To translate to physics:  change of basis = gauge transformation.  </p>\\n\\n<p>In the case of a charged particle, the wave function is the component of a one-vector section; in a new basis, this number changes by a non-zero complex number (which can vary from point to point).  Again, the wave function is a section, and a section means one vector for each point in the manifold.  How do we differentiate a function which takes values in <em>different</em> vector spaces over different points?  We need a way of <em>connecting</em> the vector spaces.  The connection does this; pragmatically, it is just a rule for doing this differentiation.  </p>\\n\\n<p>Of course, differentiation will look different in different vector spaces, so the <em>form</em> of the connection will depend on the basis and change under gauge transformations (just as the form of a linear transformation changes under change of bases).

The important ideas, again, were mostly there in the very early papers, but I would say they\\'ve been put on a somewhat more solid footing. The key point is that the bulk theory is tractable in the case when only a few fields are involved and curvatures are weak. This condition, translated to a statement about the dual field theory, is that most of the single-trace operators acquire very large anomalous dimensions (which is natural in very strongly coupled theories). Recently there has been some progress in formulating a bottom-up argument from the opposite direction, i.e. starting with the assumption that a large-$N$ conformal field theory includes few low-dimensional single-trace operators and arguing that this implies the existence of a bulk dual theory.

Actually, $\\\\psi(x,t)$ <em>itself</em> is not a section, it\\'s just the image of a section in one particular local trivialization $\\\\pi^{-1}(U) \\\\cong U\\\\times\\\\mathbb{C}$ of the vector bundle. In a different local trivialization (= a different gauge), the image will be $e^{i\\\\chi(x,t)}\\\\psi(x,t)$ with a different phase factor.</p>\\n\\n<p>Unfortunately, I feel uncomfortable with this notation.

For a section $\\\\vec v$ of the tangent bundle (= a vector field), I can write $\\\\vec v = v^\\\\mu \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x^\\\\mu}$. This expression mentions the <em>coordinates</em> $v^\\\\mu$ in a particular coordinate system, but it is also <em>invariant</em>, because I also write down the basis vector $\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x^\\\\mu}$ of the coordinate system.</p>\\n\\n<p>The great benefit of the vector notation is that it automatically deals with coordinate changes: $\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x^\\\\mu} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial y^\\\\nu}\\\\frac{\\\\partial y^\\\\nu}{\\\\partial x^\\\\mu}$.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>My question:</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>Is there a notation for sections of vector bundles that is similar to the notation $\\\\vec v = v^\\\\mu \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x^\\\\mu}$ for the tangent bundle?

       "  'Body': '<p><strong>Edit</strong>: I realized that what I\\'ve written wasn\\'t really correct, so let me change the text a little. I\\'ll mark the additions by <em>italics</em>, so that the old text stays as a reference.</p>\\n\\n<hr>\\n\\n<p>I gave a (partial) answer to this in the update of my answer to your <a href=\"https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/741/electromagnetic-field-as-a-connection-in-a-vector-bundle/752#752\">previous question </a> so let me copy&amp;paste that answer (with some modifications):</p>\\n\\n<p>The answer to the first question is no <em>but for a different reason than I stated in the above link and in the text below!</em>. There is no such notation and to see why, we first have to understand where \"coordinate-free\" vector invariance comes from. The $v$ in you question is a section of a tangent bundle $TM$ and we are decomposing it with respect to some section of the canonical tangent frame bundle $FM$, which also carries a natural action of the group $GL_k({\\\\mathbb{R}})$ (the action is a local change of basis and $k$ is the rank of $TM$). In other words, we have a $GL_k({\\\\mathbb{R}})$-structure here.</p>\\n\\n<p>The situation is superficially similar with $\\\\psi$: it is a section of a vector bundle $\\\\pi: V \\\\to M$ which carries an $U(1)$-structure. At this point it should also be clear where the difference between the two cases is: in the former you have two bundles $TM$ and $FM$ while in the latter there is only $\\\\pi: V \\\\to M$. So it doesn\\'t really make sense to ask for $\\\\psi$ to be any more invariant than it already is: you have nothing with respect to which you could decompose it. So instead of thinking about $\\\\psi$ as an analogue of section of $TM$, think of it instead as an analogue of a section of $FM$.</p>\\n\\n<p><em>I made a mistake in the above reasoning because in the case of one-dimensional $U(1)$ the concepts of $V$ and $F(V)$ (associated frame bundle) coincide. So you also have two bundles in the second case. But the difference comes from the fact that $TM$ is a very special vector bundle: it\\'s structure comes from the manifold $M$ itself, whereas $V$ is an extrinsic structure. So you certainly cannot get a decomposition with respect to coordinate derivates on $M$ as is the case of $TM$.</em></p>\\n\\n<p>As for the second question: in gauge theories one usually fixes gauge before-hand (think of Lorenz or Coulomb gauge) and work in that forever. You don\\'t really get anything interesting here by working in some \"gauge-free\" way (or at least I don\\'t know about it). So, these things really aren\\'t an issue at least until the point when you come across QFT and start wondering how to account for all this huge gauge freedom. And there it actually <em>is</em> a big problem that must be dealt with and it <em>can</em> be dealt with in various ways (including gauge-fixing). But none of this is relevant for you at this point, I guess.</p>\\n',\n",

       "  'Body': '<p>The physical process that might best be described as \"destroying the universe\" would be vacuum decay. Our entire universe might be in a <a href=\"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Metastability\">metastable</a> state, much like a supercooled liquid, and at some point quantum or thermal fluctuations could send some region of the universe into a lower ground state. If the region that tunnels to this ground state is large enough, it will expand at the speed of light, swallowing up the rest of the universe and converting it all to the lower state. This type of vacuum decay, in theories involving gravity, was calculated in a famous paper by <a href=\"http://prd.aps.org/abstract/PRD/v21/i12/p3305_1\">Coleman and de Luccia</a>. Anyone with the relevant background knowledge should read the paper, which like much of Coleman\\'s work is beautifully clear and comprehensible. One passage in the paper is particularly famous (though it arguably shouldn\\'t be taken too seriously now, given some of the assumptions it involves, including that our vacuum has exactly zero cosmological constant):</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>\"The possibility that we are living in a false vacuum has never been a cheering one to contemplate. Vacuum decay is the ultimate ecological catastrophe; in the new vacuum there are new constants of nature; after vacuum decay, not only is life as we know it impossible, so is chemistry as we know it. However, one could always draw stoic comfort from the possibility that perhaps in the course of time the new vacuum would sustain, if not life as we know it, at least some structures capable of knowing joy. This possibility has now been eliminated.\"<br/>&mdash; Sidney Coleman</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>If we live in a metastable vacuum (and, due to the observed positive cosmological constant, most physicists working on high-energy physics, cosmology, or gravity believe that we must, though there might be some unknown loopholes), then the universe will eventually decay. Luckily, the production of critical bubbles is quite rare, allowing us the time we needed to evolve and live in this metastable universe before the inevitable catastrophe. [<strong>Edited for clarification</strong> due to Marek\\'s comment: it\\'s only \"inevitable\" if our universe really is metastable, which despite strong suggestive arguments we don\\'t definitively know.] You would have to wait around for billions of years to witness the end of the universe. If you\\'re more ambitious (let\\'s hope not), you could try to cause the decay by <em>producing</em> a region of the true vacuum, thus catalyzing the process instead of letting it happen naturally. A number of crackpots have tried to start a panic over accelerator experiments by suggesting that they can do this. However, higher-energy collisions happen in nature, and we\\'re still here, so this is nothing to worry about. (There are more quantitative versions of this argument, of course. The risk really is effectively zero.)</p>\\n\\n<p>The vacuum decay processes I\\'ve mentioned don\\'t necessarily \"destroy\" the universe, they just radically alter it by leaving it in a completely different state. There is one type of vacuum decay, discovered by Witten and known as the <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0550-3213%2882%2990007-4\">bubble of nothing</a> instability, which is more radical and leaves behind nothing, not even a new vacuum state.</p>\\n',\n",

I've read what you've written and given enough time I'd be probably be able to understand whether the derivation is correct, but from top of my head I can't and, more importantly (and this answers your other question): this is not how physicists think about these problems (at least I don't know anyone who does), because once you learn Lagrange's formalism there's no need to go back to this strange principle that, as far as I know, is only used as a motivation on the road to better formalisms (Lagrange's and Hamilton's).</p>\\n\\n<p>So, here's what I'd do:</p>\\n\\n<ol>\\n<li><p>In (b), as you correctly state, the endpoint (or any other point for that matter) of the rod will be constrained to $S^1$. Now this gives us a nice way to parametrize the problem: the angle $\\\\varphi$ between the rod and the table (this is all part of the Lagrange formalism. If you haven't yet learned it, I strongly advise you do). Also let us denote by $r$ the distance between the center of mass and the point of contact with the table. We write out the Lagrangian for the center of mass (assuming the rod is homogeneous)\\n$$L(\\\\varphi, \\\\dot{\\\\varphi}) = T(\\\\varphi, \\\\dot{\\\\varphi}) - U(\\\\varphi) = m{r^2\\\\dot{\\\\varphi}^2 \\\\over 2} - mgr\\\\sin(\\\\varphi)$$\\r\\nNow just apply Lagrange's equations to obtain\\n$$mr^2\\\\ddot{\\\\varphi} = - mgr\\\\cos(\\\\varphi)$$\\r</p></li>\\n<li><p>For (a) we should assume smooth table, which means no friction, which means the rod will slide. It is clear that it will be confined to the half-plane perpendicular to the table in which the rod initially lies. We can parametrize this half-plane by $p$: the position of the point of contact of the rod with the table and $\\\\phi$ as before. Again using Lagrange formalism one obtains\\n$$L(p, \\\\varphi, \\\\dot{p}, \\\\dot{\\\\varphi}) = {m \\\\over 2}(\\\\dot{p}^2 -2r\\\\dot{p}\\\\sin(\\\\phi)\\\\dot{\\\\phi} + r^2\\\\dot{\\\\varphi}^2 ) - mgr\\\\sin(\\\\varphi)$$\\r\\nThis is not a particularly nice Lagrangian and one has to wonder whether there are some better coordinates in which the problem simplifies (as in the case (b) above).</p></li>\\n</ol>\\n\",\n",

       "  'Body': \"<p>It is the case that all measurements proceed via the exploitation of the natural interactions that we understand theoretically. But once the measurement is completed and the result in hand, the QM analysis of the subsequent evolution of just those systems that yielded that particular result can no longer employ the original state function (which allows for all the different possible results), but must then employ just that part of the original state function that corresponds to the particular result. This 'sudden' change in the state function used is called state function collapse. Many physicists regard this change as corresponding to nothing more than the change in the experimenter's knowledge once the result is in hand. This is the epistemological interpretation of the state function. But many regard the change as also reflecting a genuine physical change in the state of those systems that came through the measurement yielding the particular result. This is the ontological interpretation of the state function and it has many variations. Still many others hold an ontological interpretation of the state function while denying that collapse happens at all. </p>\\n\\n<p>These latter views, which also have many versions, have given rise to various interpretations of and/or alternatives to QM that go by names such as Pilot wave, deBroglie-Bohm, Modal interpretations, Relative state, Many Worlds, Many Minds, Consistent Histories, Decoherence theoretic, Information theoretic etc. Collectively these are all called NO-Collapse theories.</p>\\n\\n<p>The champions of real, physical collapse have also been at work creating alternative theories of their own that replace the collapse postulate by evolutions that generate collapse dynamically.

All the alternatives must, at least, reproduce the corroborated results of QM while possibly allowing for deviations in, as yet, untested waters. Some of them offer no deviations from QM, whatsoever! So deciding between them \\nand QM must be a matter of philosophy or aesthetics.

Just consider an inclined plane and suppose that the initial velocity of the ball is perpendicular to the slope. In the case where the ball is just sliding, the momentum in the perpendicular direction will be conserved. In particular, these two directions (perpendicular and along the slope) can be treated independently and you obtain a parabola as the trajectory. But  when the ball is rotating the equations of motion are quite complicated (I will try to solve them later to complete the argument) and it would surprise me hugely if the result was again parabola (not to mention the same one).</p>\\n\",\n",

In this sense, I am lead to believe only ordinary momentum and dynamics are fundamental to mechanics, with rotational stuff effectively being a corollary.</p>\\n\\n<p>Then at a later point I learned quantum mechanics. Alright, so orbital angular momentum does not really disturb my picture of the origin/fundamentality, but when we consider the concept of <em>spin</em>, this introduces a problem in this proposed (philosophical) understanding. Spin is apparently intrinsic angular momentum; that is, it applies to a point particle. Something can possess angular momentum that is not actually moving/rotating - a concept that does not exist in classical mechanics! Does this imply that angular momentum is in fact a fundamental quantity, intrinsic to the universe in some sense?</p>\\n\\n<p>It somewhat bothers me that that fundamental particles such as electrons and quarks can possess their own angular momentum (spin), when otherwise angular momentum/rotational dynamics would fall out quite naturally from normal (linear) mechanics. There are of course some fringe theories that propose that even these so-called fundamental particles are composite, but at the moment physicists widely accept the concept of intrinsic angular momentum.

Even when you have an object rotating on an own axis, this can be understood as the particles constituting the object executing an orbital motion. Of course, you can write Hamiltonians which depend on the angular momentum of the top, but these are higher level descriptions, the angular momentum of the top could still be decomposed in principle into the orbital angular momenta of its constituents. This would not be a very practical approach to problem-solving of course.</p>\\n\\n<p>Therefore, as you say, a fundamental intrinsic angular momentum is a novelty in quantum mechanics. The way it enters the equations is usually through the multiple-valuedness of the wave function. Say a spin 1/2 particle has to be described by two independent component wave functions (there could be more components, but these would not be independent). I don't know of any way around this.

Since all our elementary particles have to be described at the quantum level, what use is a classical theory of particles with intrinsic momenta?

       "  'Body': '<p><strong>Note</strong> As David pointed out, it\\'s better to distinguish between generic <em>angular momentum</em> and <em>orbital angular momentum</em>. The first concept is more general and includes spin while the second one is (as the name suggests) just about orbiting. There is also the concept of <em>total angular momentum</em> which is the quantity that is really conserved in systems with rotational symmetry. But in the absence of spin it coincides with <em>orbital angular momentum</em>. This is the situation I analyze in the first paragraph.</p>\\n\\n<hr>\\n\\n<p>Angular momentum <strong>is</strong> fundamental. Why? <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether%27s_theorem\">Noether\\'s theorem</a> tells us that the symmetry of the system (in this case space-time) leads to the conservation of some quantity (momentum for translation, orbital angular momentum for rotation). Now, as it happens, Euclidean space is both translation and rotation invariant in compatible manner, so these concepts are related and it can appear that you can derive one from the other. But there might exist space-time that is translation but not rotation invariant and vice versa. In such a space-time you wouldn\\'t get a relation between orbital angular momentum and momentum.</p>\\n\\n<p>Now, to address the spin. Again, it is a result of some symmetry. But in this case the symmetry arises because of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wigner%27s_classification\">Wigner\\'s correspondence</a> between particles and irreducible representations of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincare_group\">Poincaré group</a> which is the symmetry group of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_space\">Minkowski space-time</a>. This correspondence tells us that massive particles are classified by their mass and spin. But spin is not orbital angular momentum! The spin corresponds to group $Spin(3) \\\\cong SU(2)$ which is a double cover of $SO(3)$ (rotational symmetry of three-dimensional Euclidean space). So this is a completely different concept that is only superficially similar and can\\'t really be directly compared with orbital angular momentum. One way to see this is that spin can be a half-integer, but orbital angular momentum must always be an integer.</p>\\n\\n<p>So to summarize:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li><em>orbital angular momentum</em> is a classical concept that arises in any space-time with rotational symmetry.</li>\\n<li><em>spin</em> is a concept that comes from quantum field theory built on the Minkowski space-time. The same concept also works for classical field theory, but there we don\\'t have a clear correspondence with particles, so I omitted this case.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<hr>\\n\\n<p><strong>Addition for the curious</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>As Eric has pointed out, there is more than just a superficial similarity between orbital angular momentum and spin. To illustrate the connection, it\\'s useful to consider the question of how particle\\'s properties transform under the change of coordinates (recall that conservation of total angular momentum arises because of the invariance to the change of coordinates that corresponds to rotation). Let us proceed in a little bit more generality and consider any transformation $\\\\Lambda$ from the Lorentz group. Let us have a field $V^a(x^{\\\\mu})$ that transforms in matrix representation ${S^a}_b (\\\\Lambda)$ of the Lorentz group. Thanks to Wigner we know this corresponds to some particle; e.g. it could be scalar (like Higgs), bispinor (like electron) or vector (like Z boson). Its transformation properties under the element ${\\\\Lambda^{\\\\mu}}_{\\\\nu}$ are then determined by (using Einstein summation convention)</p>\\n\\n<p>$$ V&#39;^a ({\\\\Lambda^{\\\\mu}}_{\\\\nu} x^{\\\\nu}) = {S^a}_b(\\\\Lambda) V^b (x^{\\\\mu}) $$\\r</p>\\n\\n<p>From this one can at least intuitively see the relation between the properties of the space-time ($\\\\Lambda$) and the particle ($S$). To return to the original question: $\\\\Lambda$ contains information about the orbital angular momentum and $S$ contains information about the spin. So the two are connected but not in a trivial way. In particular, I don\\'t think it\\'s very useful to imagine spin as the actual <em>spinning</em> of the particle (contrary to the terminology). But of course anyone is free to imagine whatever they feel helps them grasp the theory better.</p>\\n',\n",

By using projective geometry, one can integrate linear and angular kinematics and dynamics in one framework (i.e. a translation is a rotation around an infinite axis; a pure moment is a force along an infinite line of action). Keywords: Felix Klein, linear complexes.</p>\\n\\n<p>Another issue is intrinsic angular momentum. I could say: study the fundamentals, the principles, and the maths, and eventually you'll get a holistic picture, but that's not what I believe. I think we are in need of some kind of <em>geometrical</em> electron model that permits us to depict intrinsic angular momentum. </p>\\n\",\n",

If you took a rigid uncooked spaghetto with a cross section of $A$, the case is quite clear - on the cylinder\\'s base in your mouth, a force of $p_{in} A$ is trying to push the spaghetto out, and on the other end, a force of $p_{out} A$ pushes it inwards. The forces generated by the pressures on the sides even out.</p>\\n\\n<p>It becomes more confusing when referring to cooked spaghetti since a) the cooked spaghetto won\\'t stick straight out from your mouth and b) we intuitively don\\'t want it to transmit forces because \"you can\\'t push on a string\".</p>\\n\\n<p>However, these complications do not change the underlying principle. Imagine cutting the spaghetto right outside your mouth while you keep sucking on the inner part. Clearly, the free spaghetto wouldn\\'t feel any net force from air pressure after the cut and just float away/fall down. By cutting, you have changed the total picture by adding $p_{out} A$ orthogonal to the cut surface, but removed the push of $p_{in} A$, so before there must have been a net force on this surface before if there is none afterwards.</p>\\n\\n<p>I know that it\\'s not the qusestion, but in this case it is much simpler to look at the basic thermodynamics - the system is basically a microcanonical ensemble, with $E = p_{out} V_{out} + p_{in} V_{in}$ under the constraint that $V_{in} + V_{out} = \\\\mathrm{const}$, and if $p_{in} &lt; p_{out}$, the minimum energy (and thus equilibrium) state is clearly that with $V_{out}=0$.</p>\\n',\n",

The question cites some papers, but is not readable on its own (not \"self-contained\").  We only learn is that there is some nonlocal theory out there which obeys some consistency conditions.

Picture a quantum field theory on (IN)xR, where IN is a spatial manifold.  Imagine that the incoming spacelike hypersurface of spacetime is a disjoint union of IN_i.  To each component IN_i we assign a Hilbert space H_i, so an incoming state is in a tensor product of the H_i.  The scattering of these states leads to an outgoing state in OUT_j, where OUT_j are the components of the outgoing spacelike hypersurface.  This map from IN states to OUT state is called the S-matrix.  \"Factorizability\" of the S-matrix says that when spacetime is made from \"gluing\" together two spacetimes along a common OUT/IN, the S-matrix map is the appropriate tensor product of maps.  (This does correspond to a locality assumption, roughly that the path integral has a continuous integrand called the action.)</p>\\n\\n<p>In two dimensions, where compact one-manifolds are very simple (always circles), this business simplifies greatly -- especially if your quantum field theory is independent of the metric on spactime -- and the \"pair-of-pants\" surface provides a multiplication map on the Hilbert space (two go in, one comes out),  the notion of an algebra.  Allowing four one-manifolds with boundary leads to the notion of a category (an algebra is a category with one object, for what it\\'s worth).</p>\\n',\n",

In particular, this means that energy will be quantized under certain circumstances (namely due to some boundary conditions or potentials limiting the amount of possible states). In classical mechanics, systems typically have a finite amount of degrees of freedom.

In quantum mechanics, the energy of the oscillator (which is a combination of position and momentum) becomes quantized.</p>\\n\\n<p>Quantum field theory takes this one step further, instead of quantizing systems with a finite amount of degrees of freedom, it tackles systems with an infinite amount, in other words fields.

       "  'Body': \"<p><strong>Update</strong> to address new questions.</p>\\n\\n<ol>\\n<li><p>The answer to this question is no. At least if you take the question purely formally. Only theories such as classical field theory, quantum field theory and continuum mechanics are field theories (you generally recognize them by having continuous degrees of freedom; also they usually have the word <em>field</em> in the title :-)). But physically, lots of different theories may be equivalent, or may be approximations of some other theory, so there are many connections among them (this is the point I was trying to illustrate, but maybe I overemphasized it).</p></li>\\n<li><p>Difference between QM and QFT is essentially the same as between classical mechanics and classical field theory. In the mechanics you have just a few particles (or more generally, small number of degrees of freedom), while fields have an infinite number of degrees of freedom. Naturally, field theories are a lot harder than the corresponding mechanics. But there is a connection I already mentioned: you can see what happens when you let the number of particles grow arbitrarily large. This system will then essentially behave as a field theory. So in a sense, we can say that field theory is a large $N$ (number of degrees of freedom) limit of the corresponding mechanical theory. Of course, this view is very simplified, but I don't want to get too technical here.</p></li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<hr>\\n\\n<p>Field theory is a theory that studies fields. Now what is a field? I suppose everyone should be familiar with at least some of them, e.g. gravitational or electromagnetic (EM) field.</p>\\n\\n<p>Now, how do you recognize that object is a field? Well, essentially, you look at how complicated the object is. To make this more precise: main objects of study of classical mechanics are point particles. All you need to keep track of them is just few parameters (position, velocity). On the other hand, consider the EM field: you need to keep track of the data (electric and magnetic field vector) in every point of the universe, so there is infinitely many parameters of this system! This is what I meant by system being large: you need a lot of data to describe it.</p>\\n\\n<p>Now, it might seem that something is amiss. You <strong>do</strong> need a lot of data to describe real objects (just think of how many atoms there are in the grain of sand). So are ordinary objects fields? Yes and no, both answers are correct depending on your point of view. If you consider a massive object as essentially being described by few parameters (like center of mass velocity and moment of inertia) and completely ignore all information about atoms then it's clearly not a field. Nevertheless, at the microscopic level, atoms wiggle around and even the grain of sand really is as complicated object as any EM field (not to mention that atoms themselves produce EM field), so it's certainly correct to call them that.</p>\\n\\n<p>Now let us see where our definition of field takes us. Let's talk about quantum mechanics for a while. What about two quantum particles? Is it a field? Well, clearly not. What about three? Still not. And what if we keep adding particles so that there will be a huge number of them? Well, it turns out that we'll get a quantum field! This is precisely the correspondence between e.g. photons and quantum EM field. You can either look at EM field as being described by vector of electric and magnetic field at every point as in the classical case, or you can instead reorganize your data so that you keep track of what kind of photons you have. It's useful to carry both pictures in head and use the more appropriate one.</p>\\n\\n<p>There is also a subject of continuum mechanics. There you can also start with particles (describing atoms in some real object, e.g. water) and because there are so many of them, you can again reorganize your data, consider the object as being essentially continuous (which real objects surely are at least unless you look at them with a microscope), and instead describe them by parameters such as pressure and temperature at every point.</p>\\n\\n<p>To summarize: the field theory is essentially about dealing with large objects. However, when we are looking at the problem with particle hat on, we usually don't say it's a field. For instance, when describing real objects as consisting of atoms, we are usually talking about statistical mechanics, or condensed matter physics. Only when we move to the realm of continuum mechanics, we say that there are fields.</p>\\n\\n<p>There is much more to be said on the topic but this post got already too long so I'll stop here. If you have any questions, ask away!</p>\\n\",\n",

Now the new signal is in a domain defined by me and so is its units. This signal although not equal to the original signal, still represents that if ya take an inverse FT. So, the idea of time will still be there. Now coming back to our case: lightyears here is not the lightyears you are used to read when dealing with distance. It represents time.</p>\\n',\n",

I\\'ll be specific though, anyway. The fourier transform of a scalar number is simply not defined (no such thing as a fourier transform of a distance, for instance). Typically fourier transforms give you a function of frequency for every function of time or of space. Under certain conditions, where there is a relationship between spatial frequency and temporal frequency (like waves propagating in a nondispersive medium here wavelength*frequency = speed of waves) you can then get a function of time for any function of space using a fourier transform, indirectly.

If p = 0, then the conserved quantity is simply x, the position of the center of mass. This obviously contradicts the whole swimming idea.</p>\\n\\n<p>What\\'s going on here?

In particular, CA have a well-defined speed of light which imposes a \\n  causal structure on their evolution, much as a Minkowski metric imposes a causal \\n  structure on spacetime. To the extent that these structures can be made to coincide \\n  between the CA and continuum cases, it makes sense to look for Lorentz invariant \\n  CA. </p>\\n  \\n  <p>The diffusion of massless particles in one spatial dimension provides a good example of a Lorentz invariant process that can be expressed in alternative mathematical \\n  forms.

A CA formulation of the process is also Lorentz invariant in the limit of low particle density and \\n  small lattice spacing. The equations can be solved with standard techniques, and the \\n  analytic solution provides a check on the results of the simulation. Generalization to \\n  higher dimensions seems to be difficult because of anisotropy of CA lattices, though \\n  it is still plausible that symmetry may emerge in complex, high-density systems. The \\n  model and analyses presented here can be used as a benchmark for further studies of \\n  symmetry in physical laws using CA. </p>\\n</blockquote>\\n',\n",

The idea would go along this line of reasoning:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>I know a man walks 5 km/h, hence</li>\\n<li>space is a unit of time because I can say 10 km is equivalent to two hours, hence</li>\\n<li>I can measure time by specifying a distance.

You define time as space traveled by something at a constant speed for a defined time, so in the end your pulled you own bootstraps.</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>My example didn\\'t make sense\\n  bacause I was wrong when I meantioned\\n  that I\\'m still measuring dist. If you\\n  have a signal in time domain and\\n  ...take the FT, I get a signal which\\n  DOES NOT HAVE to be in frequency\\n  domain.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>A Fourier transform is nothing but finding the coefficients of a linear combination of plane waves. When you find these coefficients, you can express the original function as the linear combination of these coefficients and a plane wave. If you note, there\\'s a unit relationship between the domain before the FT and after. seconds -> seconds^(-1) = Hz. So even if you want to do fourier decomposition of a space-based periodic or aperiodic system, the resulting domain will be in meters^(-1), which is eventually a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_number\" rel=\"nofollow\">wave number</a>. </p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>Clarify this to the guy who\\n  posted last. Now the new signal is in\\n  a domain defined by me and so is its\\n  units.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>Nope, it just turns out from the dimensional analysis that this is not the case. Clearly, you can always transform your frobbles units into Hertz through an ad-hoc transformation you invent (see the man-apples above) but that would still not change the final dimensional analysis of your FT, and you would, in any case, introduce an arbitrary constant (in our case above, the walking speed) which, in the end, likely produces a circular definition.</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>This signal although not equal\\n  to the original signal, still\\n  represents that if ya take an inverse\\n  FT. So, the idea of time will still be\\n  there. Now coming back to our case:\\n  lightyears here is not the lightyears\\n  you are used to read when dealing with\\n  distance. It represents time.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>Lightyears is a measure of distance. It is a product of two well defined constants: the speed of light and a well defined amount of time. Simple dimensional analysis tells you it\\'s a distance.</p>\\n\\n<p>Edit: non-tech note. there\\'s nothing wrong not to know things. Tell your friend it\\'s not my intention to mock him. There\\'s, however, something wrong to pretend to be right through misunderstood justification. It looks like he is mature enough to understand he is wrong, which is the spirit we should all live with. I hope my answers clarifies his doubts. Note that I could be wrong myself. I don\\'t know the technicalities of standard unit definitions, and my exposition could be patched by someone who knows more than me on this field. The approximation I present here is good enough for the purpose of explanation, but it is wrong nevertheless when we go down to the gritty details, and I am ready to accept criticism on this regard.

       "  'Body': '<p>As other people answered, the force is a vector quantity, so the net force at the center is indeed zero. But it seems what you have in mind is actually the pressure (stress) at that particular point. </p>\\n\\n<p>Firstly, regarding your question. What you are computing is\\n$$ \\\\sum_{\\\\substack{i\\\\in\\\\text{first part}\\\\\\\\j\\\\in\\\\text{second part}}} \\\\mathbf F_{ij} $$\\r\\nthe total force acting on each particle on the first part due to the second part. This is not equivalent to \"force at X\". But anyway, but why do you get infinity? Because <em>this is the answer</em>.</p>\\n\\n<p>If we compute the gravitational field due to the 2nd part ($\\\\lambda=M/L$):\\n$$ g(h) = G\\\\lambda \\\\int_0^{L/2} \\\\frac{1}{(z+h)^2}dz = \\\\frac{G\\\\lambda L}{h(2h+L)}, $$\\r\\nwe find that the gravitational force scales as $\\\\frac1h$. Now suppose you split the first part into $N$ blobs. The position of the $i$-th blob closest to the center will be $h_i=\\\\frac{Li}{2N}$, its mass will be $\\\\frac{\\\\lambda L}{2N}$, so together the contribution of force of each blob will be $F_i = m_ig(h_i) \\\\sim \\\\frac{1/N}{i/N} = \\\\frac1i$, and the <em>total</em> force is $\\\\sim\\\\sum_{i=1}^N\\\\frac1i\\\\sim\\\\ln N$ which diverges logarithmically to $\\\\infty$.</p>\\n\\n<p>This sounds unphysical, but this is because the setting itself is unphysical — you can\\'t have a mass with no \"width\" but finite mass, this makes the density infinite, and this causes the infinite force as the two part are right next to each other.</p>\\n\\n<p>So let\\'s makes sense when the bar has size. So assume that bar is a cylinder of radius $\\\\epsilon \\\\to 0$. Also assume the bar\\'s density is $\\\\rho = M/\\\\pi\\\\epsilon^2L$. The gravity field along the z direction is then\\n$$ g(h) = G\\\\rho \\\\int_0^{L/2} \\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} \\\\int_0^{\\\\epsilon} \\\\frac{h+z}{((h+z)^2+r^2)^{3/2}} rdrd\\\\phi dz = G\\\\rho\\\\pi  \\\\left(2 \\\\sqrt{h^2+\\\\epsilon ^2}-\\\\sqrt{(2 h+L)^2+4 \\\\epsilon ^2}+L\\\\right), $$\\r\\nand the force is now bounded above by a constant $G\\\\rho\\\\pi(2\\\\epsilon+L-\\\\sqrt{4\\\\epsilon^2+L^2})$ for varying $h$, and the total force by partitioning the 1st part would be $\\\\sim \\\\sum_{i=1}^N\\\\frac{\\\\text{constant}}N = \\\\text{constant}$ as you would expect. (Nevertheless, this constant will diverge with $1/\\\\epsilon$ as $\\\\epsilon\\\\to0$.)</p>\\n\\n<hr>\\n\\n<p>But the result above has nothing to do with the pressure. At precisely the center, there is no force, and the magnitude of force scales as $r$ in its immediate neighborhood. </p>\\n\\n<p>Let\\'s mark a small square membrane of size $a\\\\times a\\\\times dz$ with negligible mass $a^2\\\\rho dz$ at position $z\\\\to0$ above the center of the bar to record the pressure.</p>\\n\\n<p>The membrane will experience a <em>net</em> push from above. Since the membrane is small, we could assume it is a uniform force. The total force that pushes the membrane downwards is\\n$$\\\\begin{aligned} F &amp;= a^2\\\\rho dz g_{\\\\text{total}}(z) \\\\\\\\\\r\\n&amp;= a^2\\\\rho dz\\\\cdot G\\\\rho\\\\pi \\\\left(\\\\sqrt{(L+2z)^2+4\\\\epsilon^2}-\\\\sqrt{(L-2z)^2+4\\\\epsilon^2}\\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\r\\n&amp;\\\\sim  \\\\frac{4a^2z\\\\rho dz\\\\cdot G\\\\rho L\\\\pi }{\\\\sqrt{L^2+4\\\\epsilon^2}}\\r\\n \\\\end{aligned}$$\\r\\nand thus the pressure is \\n$$ dP = -\\\\frac F{a^2} = -\\\\frac{4zG\\\\rho^2 L\\\\pi dz }{\\\\sqrt{L^2+4\\\\epsilon^2}} \\\\sim 4zdz \\\\frac{GM^2}{L^2\\\\epsilon^4} $$\\r\\n$$ \\\\implies P \\\\sim -z^2 \\\\frac{GM^2}{2L^2\\\\epsilon^4} $$\\r\\nnote that the $z$ is still here. We see that the pressure is <em>finite</em> and maximal when we measure it <em>precisely at the center</em> (and decreases away from it). But this will diverge if we let $\\\\epsilon\\\\to0$.</p>\\n',\n",

This, in the end of the day, is the reason why both classical theories look similar.</p>\\n\\n<p>But, when you <em>really</em> study what\\'s going on behind the scene, you learn that Gravity is more appropriately described by General Relativity (GR) and ElectroMagnetism is better described by Quantum ElectroDynamics (QED).</p>\\n\\n<p>The resemblance of these two theories, one may say, rests in the fact that both are described by the same mathematical framework: a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_bundle\">principle bundle</a>. In GR\\'s (ie, gravity) case this bundle is a Tangent Bundle (or an $SO(3,1)$-bundle) and in QED\\'s (ie, E&amp;M) case it\\'s a $U(1)$-bundle. The geometric structure is the same, what changes is the \"gauge group\", the object that describes the symmetries of each theory.</p>\\n\\n<p>Under this new sense, then, your question could be posed this way: <em>\"Is there a way to modify geometry in order to incorporate both of the symmetries of these two theories?\"</em></p>\\n\\n<p>Now, this question was attacked by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Weyl\">Hermann Weyl</a> in his book <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=KCgZAQAAIAAJ\">Space, Time and Matter</a>, giving birth to what we now call <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_theory\">Gauge Theory</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>As it turns out, Weyl\\'s observations amounts to a slight change on what symmetries we use to describe Gravity: rather than only using $SO(3,1)$, Weyl used a different group of symmetries, called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_symmetry\">Conformal</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>As Einstein later showed, it turns out that if you try and describe Gravity and E&amp;M using this generalized group of symmetries (under this new geometrical framework of principle bundles) you do not get the appropriate radiation rates for atoms, ie, atoms which we know to be stable (they don\\'t spontaneously decay radioactively) would not be so under Weyl\\'s proposal.</p>\\n\\n<p>After this blow, this notion of <em>unifying</em> Gravity and E&amp;M via a generalization of the geometry (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_(principal_bundle)\">principal bundles</a>) that describes both of them, was put aside: it\\'s virtually impossible to get stable atoms (stability of matter) this way.</p>\\n\\n<p>But, people tried a slightly different construction: they posited that spacetime was 5-dimensional (rather than 4-dimensional, as we see everyday) and constructed something called \\na <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaluza_Klein\">Kaluza-Klein</a> theory.</p>\\n\\n<p>So, rather than encode the E&amp;M symmetries by changing the geometry via the use of the Conformal Group, they changed it by increasing its dimension.</p>\\n\\n<p>Now, this proposal has its own drawbacks, for instance, the sore thumb that is <em>supradimensionality</em>, ie, the fact that spacetime is assumed to be 5-dimensional (rather than 4-dim) — there are other technicalities, but let\\'s leave those for later.</p>\\n\\n<p>The bottom-line is that it\\'s proven very hard to describe gravity together with the other forces of Nature. In fact, we can describe the Strong Force, the Wear Force and ElectroMagnetism all together: this is called the \"Standard Model of Particle Physics\".

This is for example the case of the prototypical <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_metric\">black-hole solution</a> of GTR. Now, this space-time exists a priori (by definition of static: it always was there and always will be), so the gravity doesn\\'t really need to propagate. As GTR tells us gravity is only an illusion left on us by the curved space-time. So there is no paradox here: black holes appear to be gravitating (as in producing some force and being dynamical) but in fact they are completely static and no propagation of information is needed. In reality we know that black-holes are not completely static but this is a correct first approximation to that picture.</p>\\n\\n<p>Now, to address the dynamical part, two different things can be meant by this:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>Actual global change of space-time as can be seen e.g. in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_expansion_of_space\">expansion of the universe</a>. This expansion need not obey the speed of light but this is in no contradiction with any known law. In particular you cannot send any superluminal signals. In fact, opposite is true: by too quick an expansion parts of universe might go too far away for even their light to ever reach us.

So it shouldn\\'t be surprising that no information can be communicated.</li>\\n<li>Gravitational waves, which is a just fancy name for the disturbances in the underlying space-time.

This way we can focus simply in Classical GR, ie, the Differential Geometry of Spacetime: this is more than enough to address your question.</p>\\n\\n<p>In this setting, GR is a theory that says how much curvature a space \"suffers\" given a certain amount of mass (or energy, cf <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress-energy_tensor\">Stress-Energy Tensor</a>).</p>\\n\\n<p>A <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole\">Black Hole</a> is a region of spacetime that has such an intense curvature that it \"pinches out\" a certain region of spacetime.</p>\\n\\n<p>In this sense, it\\'s not too bad to understand what\\'s going on: if you can measure the curvature of spacetime, you can definitely tell whether or not you\\'re moving towards a region of increasing curvature (ie, towards a block hole).</p>\\n\\n<p>This is exactly what\\'s done: one measures the curvature of spacetime and that\\'s enough: at some point, the curvature is so intense that the light-cones are \"flipped\".

       "  'Body': '<p>The reason you encountered higher and higher pressure at the center of the rod as you cut it into more pieces is that you were essentially approximating an integral, but the integral diverges (\"is infinity\" colloquially).  When the rod has zero thickness, but still has mass, the density of the matter is infinite, and this leads to infinitely strong gravitational forces.</p>\\n\\n<p>To answer this question, we\\'ll imagine the cylinder has some small, finite radius $R$.  We want to find the force between the two halves of the cylinder.  We\\'ll let one half just sit stationary in space.  It will create a gravitational potential.  Then we\\'ll grab the other half and pull it away to some distance $d$.  The gravitational potential energy is a function of $d$.  The force between the two halves of the cylinder is the derivative of the gravitational potential energy with respect to $d$ when $d=0$.</p>\\n\\n<p>The problem described above is too hard.  It is quite difficult to calculate the gravitational potential of a cylinder at an arbitrary point.  The gravitational potential of a point mass is just $-Gm/r$, but for a cylinder that extends out in three dimensions, we need to replace $m$ with the density $\\\\rho$ and then integrate over the mass of the entire cylinder.  The expression for $r$, the distance from an arbitrary point outside the cylinder to a point inside it, is not very tractable.  </p>\\n\\n<p>However, at a point on the axis of the cylinder, the gravitational potential is more accessible due to the extra symmetry.  If we set up cylindrical coordinates with the axis of the cylinder along the z-axis, and then integrate over the bottom half of the cylinder, we get</p>\\n\\n<p>$V(z) = \\\\int_{z&#39;=0}^{-L/2}\\\\int_{r=0}^{R}\\\\int_{\\\\theta=0}^{2\\\\Pi} \\\\frac{G\\\\rho}{\\\\sqrt{(z-z&#39;)^2+r^2}} r\\\\textrm{d}\\\\theta\\\\textrm{d}r\\\\textrm{d}z&#39;$\\r</p>\\n\\n<p>and doing the integral of $\\\\theta$ it\\'s</p>\\n\\n<p>$V(z) = 2\\\\pi G\\\\rho\\\\int_{z&#39;=0}^{-L/2}\\\\int_{r=0}^{R} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{(z-z&#39;)^2+r^2}} r\\\\textrm{d}r\\\\textrm{d}z&#39;$.</p>\\n\\n<p>This allows us to make an approximation.  Although the half of the cylinder we use to calculate the potential must have finite width, we can calculate the potential energy by assuming that the other half of the cylinder is located perfectly along the axis.  As long as the radius of the cylinder is very small compared to the length, this is a valid approximation.  So the potential energy comes from integrating the previous expression for $V$ along the $z$-axis for the length of the cylinder.</p>\\n\\n<p>We don\\'t actually want the potential energy, but the derivative of the potential energy.  So we imagine moving the top half up the cylinder up a little bit $dz$, and ask how the potential energy changes.</p>\\n\\n<p>Moving the entire top half of the cylinder up by $dz$ is equivalent to taking a piece of thickness $dz$ and slicing it off the bottom and moving it to the top.  So we really just need to find the difference in the potential between the top and bottom of the top half of the cylinder and multiply by the mass-per-unit-length of the cylinder.</p>\\n\\n<p>The force between the two halves of the cylinder is $\\\\frac{M}{L}[V(L/2) - V(0)]$\\r</p>\\n\\n<p>That still leaves two integrals to evaluate.  $V(L/2)$ is easy, because it\\'s far away from the half of the cylinder providing the gravitational potential (compared to $R$).

We just don't know, given the existing state  of physics knowledge, how far we can push the idea.  </p>\\n\\n<p>When charged particle attract or repel, the force is due to  virtual photons.  Photons <em>like</em> to travel at  the universal speed <i>c</i>, but they  don't have to.  Heisenberg says so! You can break the laws of conservation of energy and  momentum as much as you like, but the more you deviate, the shorter the time span and smaller the bit of space in which you violate these laws.  For the virtual photons connecting two charged particles, they've got the room  between the two particles, and a time span matching that at lightspeed.  These not running waves with a well-defined wavelength, period or phase velocity.  This ill-defined velocity can be faster than c or less equally well.  In QED, the photon propagator - the wavefunction giving the probability amplitude of a virtual photon connecting (x1, t1) to (x2, t2) is nonzero everywhere - inside and outside the past and future light cones, though becoming unlimited in magnitude on the light cones.</p>\\n\\n<p>So gravitons, if they are that  much like photons, can exist just fine outside the horizon and inside.   They are, in a rough sense, as big as the space between the black hole and whatever is orbiting or falling into it.  Don't  picture them as little energy  pellets flying from the black  hole center (singularity or whatever) - even with Heisenberg's indulgence, it's just not a matter of small particles  trying to get  through the horizon the wrong way.   A graviton is probably already on both sides!  </p>\\n\\n<p>For a more satisfying answer, I suspect it takes knowing the math,Fourier transforms, Riemann tensors and all that.  </p>\\n\",\n",

       "  'Body': '<p>It all comes down to a balance between a number of different physical interactions.</p>\\n\\n<p>The binding energy of a nucleus is commonly described with the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-empirical_mass_formula\">semiempirical mass formula</a>:</p>\\n\\n<p>$$E(A, Z) = a_V A - a_S A^{2/3} - a_C \\\\frac{Z(Z-1)}{A^{1/3}} - a_A \\\\frac{(A-2Z)^2}{A} + \\\\delta(A,Z)$$</p>\\n\\n<p>where $A = Z + N$ is the total number of nucleons, $Z$ the number of protons, and $N$ the number of neutrons.</p>\\n\\n<p>The different contributions have physical explanation as:</p>\\n\\n<ol>\\n<li>$a_V$ : volume term, the bigger the volume the more nucleons interact with each other through the strong interaction, the more they attract each other</li>\\n<li>$a_S$ : surface term, similar to the surface tension, some energy stored in there, reducing the binding interaction</li>\\n<li>$a_C$ : the Coulomb repulsion of the protons within the nucleus</li>\\n<li>$a_A$ : asymmetry term, rooted in the Pauli exclusion principle. Basically if there are more of one type of nucleon (generally of neutrons) then the overall energy is larger than needs to be thus decreasing the binding energy (note: $A-2Z = Z - N$)</li>\\n<li>$\\\\delta$ : pairing term, depends on whether there are even or odd number of nucleons altogether and even or odd number of protons/neutrons. In empirical description usually modeled as a continuous variable $a_P/A^{1/2}$.</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<p>This is of the expression for the <strong>total</strong> binding energy, what is interesting is the binding energy <strong>per nucleon</strong>, as a measure of stability:</p>\\n\\n<p>$$E(A, Z)/A \\\\approx a_V - a_S \\\\frac{1}{A^{1/3}} - a_C \\\\frac{Z(Z-1)}{A^{4/3}} - a_A \\\\frac{(A-2Z)^2}{A^2} + a_P \\\\frac{1}{A^{3/2}}$$</p>\\n\\n<p>To see which nucleus (what value of $A$) is the most stable one has to find for which $A$ is this function maximal. At this point $Z$ is arbitrary but we should chose a physically meaningful value. From theoretical point of view a good choice is the $Z$ that gives the highest binding energy for a given $A$ (the most stable isotope), for which we need to solve solve $\\\\frac{\\\\partial (E/A)}{\\\\partial Z} = 0$. The results is $Z_{stable}(A) \\\\approx \\\\dfrac12\\\\dfrac{A}{1+A^{2/3} \\\\frac{a_C}{4 a_A}}$. After putting back the $Z_{stable}(A)$ into $E(A, Z)/A$ one can maximize the function value to get the \"optimal number\" of nucleons for the most stable element. Depending on the empirically determined values of $a_S, a_C, a_A, a_P$ the maximum will occur in the area $A \\\\approx 58 \\\\ldots 63$.</p>\\n\\n<p>The interpretation of this result is something like this:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>for <strong>small atoms</strong> (small $A$) the biggest contribution is the <strong>surface term</strong> (they have a large surface-to-volume ratio), and they want increase the number of nucleons to reduce it - hence you have fusion</li>\\n<li>for <strong>large atoms</strong> (large $A$) the <strong>Coulomb term</strong> increases because more protons mean more repulsion between them, and also, to keep everything together more neutrons are needed (thus $N \\\\gg Z$ which makes the <strong>asymmetry term</strong> larger as well. By ejecting some nucleons (alpha decay), or converting between neutrons and protons (beta decay) the nucleus can reduce this terms.</li>\\n<li>optimally bound $A$ (and $Z$) happens when these two groups of competing contributions balance each others out.</li>\\n</ul>\\n',\n",

       "  'Body': '<p>One formative book for me was Ed Purcell\\'s <a href=\"http://goo.gl/JjqHs\">Electricity and Magnetism</a>.  Purcell was my early education in thinking like a physicist.  It introduced me to thought experiments, simple models, and the usefulness of new mathematical tools.  It\\'s mathematically very clear, and physically insightful.  The problems are extremely rich.  It manages a huge deal of physics without much unnecessary computation.  When I post replies to physics questions on this board, I sometimes wonder how Purcell would handle it - setting out the physical principles first, carrying out the calculations as clearly and succinctly as possible, and using physical insight for shortcuts and simplifications.  I doubt I will ever live up to his model, though.</p>\\n\\n<p>My entire freshman class read Purcell during second quarter.  In conversation later, I heard over and over from people that after reading chapter 5, \"The Fields Of Moving Charges\", they were so awestruck by this 25-page illustrated introduction to relativistic E&amp;M that when they finished, they stared at the wall for about ten minutes, then read the entire thing over again.</p>\\n\\n<p>Also from the Berkeley physics series, Frank Crawford\\'s <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=JLURAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=crawford+waves&amp;dq=crawford+waves&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=LYPjTIGPDYf6sAPXiaVm&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA\">Waves</a> is charming, delving into many interesting wave phenomena with very nice explanations.</p>\\n\\n<p>James Nearing\\'s <a href=\"http://www.physics.miami.edu/~nearing/mathmethods/\">free book, Mathematical Methods for Physics</a> on undergraduate math methods deserves more attention that it gets.

Those are just vortex rings that are only visualised by dolphins by filling their cores with air (you can see this happening about 0:12).<br>\\nAt first the rings grow to optimize vortex core size, but the most increase is made by the fact that dolphins make water flow through the ring (you can see they kinda push the rings through the water). The speed of each point on a vortex ring in localised induction approximation is $\\\\dot{\\\\vec{s}}=\\\\frac{\\\\beta}{R}\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{b}}$, where $\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{b}}$ is a binormal vector of the ring, $\\\\beta$ is constant and $R$ is the diameter of the ring; so when the dolphin pushes the ring its effective speed decreases and so its diameter must increase. Not counting friction, free ring holds its diameter.</p>\\n\\n<p>The making of small rings is due to the fact that dolphins distort the ring making it reconnect with itself. Two rings are created in the process, small and big, yet the big degenerates in eddies created by the dolphin swimming past it to play with the smaller one.</p>\\n',\n",

So let me make his statements a bit more precise.</p>\\n\\n<p>The correct approach is to treat the Newtonian gravity as a perturbation of the flat <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_space\">Minkowski space-time</a>. One writes $g = \\\\eta + h$ for the metric of this space-time ($\\\\eta$ being Minkowski metric and $h$ being the perturbation that encodes curvature of the space-time) and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linearized_gravity#Linearised_Einstein_field_equations\">linearize</a> the theory in $h$. By doing this one actually obtains a lot more than just Newtonian gravity, namely <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitomagnetism\">gravitomagnetism</a>, in which one can also investigate dynamical properties of the space-time not included in the Newtonian picture. In particular the propagation of gravitational waves.</p>\\n\\n<p>Now, to recover Newtonian gravity we have to make one more approximation. Just realize that Newtonian gravity is not relativistic, i.e. it violates finite speed of light. But if we assume that $h$ changes only slowly and make calculations we will find out that the perturbation metric $h$ encodes the Newtonian field potential $\\\\Phi$ and that the space-time is curved in precisely the way to reproduce the Newtonian gravity. Or rather (from the modern perspective): Newtonian picture is indeed a correct low-speed, almost-flat description of GR.</p>\\n',\n",

A very famous example is the Bullet cluster where you can clearly observe the effects of a compact mass acting as an optical lens. A mass of such magnitude can not conveniently be a cluster of brown dwarves and most black holes we observe have many objects orbiting and a particle jet accompanying. Besides, a black hole of small magnitude would not be enough to explain the magnitude of the gravitational lensing in question.</p>\\n\\n<p>Secondly, much more complicated computations made with general relativity principles need a lot more mass to account for the current shape and angular speed of galaxies. It may be easy to say that GR is wrong(which you shouldn\\'t say to the face of a physicist), even though GR is incomplete in the sense that it is not a theory of everything, it still explains most of the gravitational phenomena pretty well. Besides, the fact that there is gravitational lensing means that there really IS some sort of mass or gravitational pull(or more like space time curvature anomaly) in certain parts of our galaxy, and the universe.</p>\\n\\n<p>Even though dark matter seems so mysterious, we can guess most of its properties from our \"lack of knowledge\". Firstly, since it is \"invisible\" in all spectrum of light, we can assume that it does not interact via electromagnetic force. Since it is a fountain of gravitational force, we can say that it, surprise surprise, interacts via gravitational force. Calculations for weak&amp;strong forces are pretty complicated and very indirect so I\\'m just going to say that most of the currently proposed dark matters interact via strong and weak forces as well.</p>\\n\\n<p>A planetary system without a star is only possible if the star died out to be a neutron star, black hole, or a white dwarf, all of which are detectable in some way.</p>\\n\\n<p>Besides, there would have to be an unrealistic amount of these \"faded\" star systems to even account for the lost mass.

There is some point where the mass is stable: it can be left alone with no external forces on it and will not accelerate. That\\'s the equilibrium, call it $x_0$. If you move the mass from that point, the spring exerts a restoring force $F = -k(x-x_0)$.

       "  'Body': '<p>I was once trying to push a large log off a hiking trail trail.  The log had been there a while and had sunk into the dirt, so to push it out I would have to push hard enough to  force it up out of the depression.  I kicked at it, but couldn\\'t kick it hard enough to get it out.  I was with a couple other people, so we all kicked it, but again we couldn\\'t get it out.  What did happen was that it rolled up a little way out of its hole, then rolled back towards us and  climbed a small way out of its hole in the opposite direction.  Finally it rolled back the way we originally kicked it again.</p>\\n\\n<p>We soon caught on to the idea of kicking the log, waiting for it to roll back towards us, then roll the other way, and kick it again while it was already rolling the direction we wanted it to go.  With a little effort, this strategy finally let us roll the log out of its depression and off to the side of the trail.</p>\\n\\n<p>The log was exhibiting simple harmonic motion - it shook back and forth at a certain frequency, oscillating around the spot it would stay at rest.  Our kicks were timed to coincide with the period of the log\\'s oscillations.  This is called achieving \"resonance\".</p>\\n\\n<p>The log was not a perfect simple harmonic oscillator because it would only shake back and forth a few times before settling down again.  Ideally, a  simple harmonic oscillator will shake back and forth indefinitely.  Further, it can shake more or less vigorously (different amplitude of the sine wave), but it will always have the same period and move sinusoidally.</p>\\n\\n<p>Many mechanical systems are close to simple harmonic oscillators.  A pendulum in a clock is a good example.  If you take a rectangular or vertical cylindrical ice cube floating in water and tap it very gently, it will oscillate up and down in harmonic motion with a period of around a half a second.  The water itself is a harmonic oscillator, too.  If you give it a short shove across the table, you\\'ll see the entire surface of the water shake back and forth in a characteristic way called the \"sloshing mode\".  Electrical circuits with an inductor and a capacitor make extremely good simple harmonic oscillators.  A quartz crystal is a good one, too.  Since it oscillates with a definite period, it makes for a good clock.  Older clocks use a different simple harmonic oscillator, a wound up spring that shakes back and forth.  If a roller coaster were to roll back and forth at the bottom of a hill, it would be a simple harmonic oscillator, too.  If you dug a hole from the north pole to the south pole and dropped something in, gravity would swing it back and forth through the Earth in simple harmonic oscillation.  </p>\\n\\n<p>Simple harmonic oscillators can be used to describe molecular or atomic systems.  You can discover a lot about the way that light interacts with matter simply by pretending that an electron attached to an atom is a simple harmonic oscillator, and molecules like CO2 vibrate like simple harmonic oscillators as well.  Even you are a simple harmonic oscillator.  Spread your feet, make yourself rigid, and rock back and forth from foot to foot, staying stiff so that the foot not supporting your weight actually comes off the ground.  You\\'ll find that as long as you don\\'t go too far, there\\'s a certain frequency that your body wants to rock at, and that this frequency changes when you change the distance between your feet.</p>\\n\\n<p>There are many caveats to all this.  These systems are subject to friction, so they run down eventually, unlike an ideal simple harmonic oscillator.  Most of them are simple harmonic oscillators only for small amplitudes.  If you push the entire ice cube under water, it doesn\\'t obey a sine wave oscillation any more.  The roller coaster, even if frictionless, is only a simple harmonic oscillator if the shape of the track is a special shape called a brachistochrone.  The hole through the Earth only results in simple harmonic motion under the false assumption that the density of Earth is constant.</p>\\n\\n<p>Nonetheless, these models are extremely useful at explaining natural phenomena.  A large body of water like a lake or bay is a simple harmonic oscillator in the same way as the glass of water pushed across the table to excite the sloshing mode.  But the period of the sloshing mode gets longer and longer as the body of water gets bigger.  For the Bay of Fundy, the sloshing mode is very close to twelve hours.  Since the tides come once every twelve hours, the tides act in a way very similar to the way my friends and I kicked the heavy log out of its hole.  The tides build up very strongly, and tides there can be ten meters!</p>\\n\\n<p>Engineers will have to worry about this resonance phenomenon all the time.  The most famous example is the Tacoma Narrows suspension bridge, which started shaking wildly and finally collapsed on a windy day when the turbulent eddies of the wind were in resonance with the bridge.  If you\\'re building a building, you don\\'t want it to undergo simple harmonic motion at the same frequency as earthquake waves, and you don\\'t want the suspension on a car to have the same frequency as some sort of regular dip in the road, for example.</p>\\n',\n",

       "  'Body': \"<p>All the matter that we <em>do</em> know to exist (called Baryonic matter) emits <em>some</em> kind of electromagnetic radiation at <em>some</em> frequency. Sometimes it's measured in infrared radiation, because matter, no matter how cold, will still radiate some amount of heat. To the best of our knowledge, it's not actually possible to cool any matter to absolute zero, and it's certainly not happening naturally. I believe the coolest matter known to exist in the universe is around 3 degrees Kelvin. Other wavelengths can determine the exact nature of the matter in question, and its temperature. For example, ionized oxygen glows in visible light at a certain wavelength - that's one of the things that make emission nebulae visible.</p>\\n\\n<p>So, after measuring all that matter in other galaxies, we've noticed that there's simply not enough mass to keep them from falling apart (namely, stars within galaxies are moving faster than the escape velocity of the gravitational pull of the center of mass of the galaxy) - especially when we've tried to make computer models of galaxies. That was the first clue that there was something going on that we didn't fully understand. As others have described, other methods of determining the total mass of a galaxy have shown similar results.</p>\\n\\n<p>As a result, there's only one possible explanation for this phenomenon: there must be some kind of matter (and all matter has mass) that we <em>can't</em> detect. In fact, the amount of mass that can't be accounted for in this way is about 95% of the mass of any given galaxy. Of course, that's a pretty big deal. </p>\\n\\n<p>By the way, we've been trying to work out this very large discrepancy since 1933. The difference between now and then is that accuracy of our measurements of velocity of stars in other galaxies has improved, as well as our ability to measure other phenomena happening within galaxies and galaxy clusters. The more accurate we've become in our measurements, the more this glaring discrepancy has become evident.</p>\\n\",\n",

       "  'Body': '<p>This echoes some of the other responses, but simple harmonic motion is <em>universal</em> in the following sense.  A system displaced from equilibrium will exhibit some force (possibly zero) as a function of the displacement.  \"Equilibrium\" means that if x is the displacement coordinate, then the response force F(x) obeys F(0)=0.  So if we Taylor expand F in x we get F(x) = 0 + F\\'(0)x + F\\'\\'(0)x^2/2 + ..., where here x can be a multi-coordinate, F vector-valued, with F\\' a Jacobian, etc.  The point is that for small displacements, the linear term is a good approximation (it is nonzero generically, but not always) and the equations take the form d^2x^i/dt^2 = \\\\sum_j (dF^i/dx^j)(0) x^j.  This linear system is reducible to copies of simple harmonic motion if we can diagonalize the matrix F\\'(0) (e.g., if the force is conservative this is symmetric, a Hessian, and therefore diagonalizable).  This same reasoning works in infinite dimensions, formally, so in quantum field theory.  If you want an everyday example, kick a wall.  It will shake.  This is why.</p>\\n',\n",

       "  'Body': '<p>First, I\\'ll state some background that lead me to the question.</p>\\n\\n<p>I was thinking about quantization of space-time on and off for a long time but I never really looked into it any deeper (mainly because I am not yet quite fluent in string theory). But the recent discussion about <a href=\"https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/937/how-does-gravity-escape-a-black-hole/953#953\">propagation of information in space-time</a> got me thinking about the topic again. Combined with the fact that it has been more or less decided that <a href=\"https://physics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/94/level-of-questions-what-do-we-do-now\">we should also ask graduate level questions here</a>, I decided I should give it a go.</p>\\n\\n<hr>\\n\\n<p><em>So, first some of my (certainly very naive) thoughts.</em></p>\\n\\n<p>It\\'s no problem to quantize gravitational waves on a curved background. They don\\'t differ much from any other particles we know. But what if we want the background itself to change in response to movement of the matter and quantize these processes? Then I would imagine that space-time itself is built from tiny particles (call them <em>space-timeons</em>) that interact by means of exchanging gravitons. I drawed this conclusion from an analogy with how solid matter is built from atoms in a lattice and interact by means of exchanging phonons.</p>\\n\\n<p>Now, I am aware that the above picture is completely naive but I think it must in some sense also be correct. That is, if there exists any reasonable notion of quantum gravity, it <em>has to</em> look something like that (at least on the level of QFT).</p>\\n\\n<p>So, having come this far I decided I should not stop. So let\\'s move one step further and assume string theory is correct description of the nature. Then all the particles above are actually strings. So I decided that space-time must probably arise as condensation of huge number of strings. Now does this make any sense at all? To make it more precise (and also to ask something in case it doesn\\'t make a sense), I have two questions:</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <ol>\\n  <li><p>In what way does the classical space-time arise as a limit in the string theory? Try to give a clear, conceptual description of this process. I don\\'t mind some equations, but I want mainly ideas.</p></li>\\n  <li><p>Is there a good introduction into this subject? If so, what is it? If not, where else can I learn about this stuff?</p></li>\\n  </ol>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>Regarding 2., I would prefer something not too advanced. But to give you an idea of what kind of literature might be appropriate for my level: I already now something about classical strings, how to quantize them (in different quantization schemes) and some bits about the role of CFT on the worldsheets. Also I have a qualitative overview of different types of string theories and also a little quantitative knowledge about moduli spaces of Calabi-Yau manifolds and their properties.</p>\\n',\n",

If I have two chunks of matter of the same type on top of one another, one can\\'t imagine that the explanation for the fact that these chunks don\\'t \"fall through\" each other would be unrelated to the explanation of why we do not fall through the ground. So, in ultimate analysis, the question is tied to the question of stability of matter. </p>\\n\\n<p>Now, there are several steps in the problem. To explain the stability of matter, one has to explain why atoms are stable (and before that why nuclei are stable), then one has to explain why aggregates of atoms like solids or liquids can be stable, i.e. why bulk matter is stable. The stability of bulk matter will then serve as the basis to explain why \"we can stand on the ground\".</p>\\n\\n<p>Starting with the last step and assuming we already know about the stability of bulk matter, we can imagine that when we exert a pressure on stable bulk matter, we can expect by what it means to be in a stable equilibrium, that the piece of matter would exert an opposing pressure, trying to restore itself to its most stable configuration, provided stresses are not too great. So solving the problem of stability of bulk matter will help us understand what the nature of the restoring force will be.</p>\\n\\n<p>Now, as is well known, electromagnetic forces can not be the sole explanation. There exist no stable equilibria when there are only electric charges interacting electromagnetically. I won\\'t go through the proof here, but it is accessible to undergraduates, it can be found in the Feynman Lectures, book 2, chapter 5. It\\'s an application of Gauss\\' law in the static case. The dynamic case only complicates matters in the wrong direction. As we know, accelerated charges radiate energy away, thus an electron orbiting a nucleus would soon fall inward if nothing prevented it, to take the classic example.</p>\\n\\n<p>Enters Elliott Lieb and his paper \\'<a href=\"http://www.pas.rochester.edu/~rajeev/phy246/lieb.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">The stability of matter</a>\\' that can be easily found online. So, I\\'ll quote a lot from there. It reviews a lot of the results in the field of mathematical physics of the problem of stability of matter. </p>\\n\\n<p>So what does Lieb essentially say about stability of atoms: that it is a consequence of a principle introduced by Sobolev. Sobolev\\'s inequality states in a mathematically precise form that if one tries to compress the wavefunction anywhere, the kinetic energy will increase. It\\'s a kind of stronger version of the HUP. (Note that at this point, Lieb does not use Pauli\\'s exclusion principle. This is to be expected, take a hydrogen atom, it is stable, since there\\'s only one electron, Pauli\\'s exclusion principle can\\'t be invoked here to explain its stability.)</p>\\n\\n<p>Then, Lieb goes on to explain the stability of bulk matter by using Sobolev\\'s inequality again. But this time around, he extends the inequality, and takes into account the fact that matter is made up of fermions. So, the Pauli exclusion principle is indeed used. So, again a lower bound for the kinetic energy is found, the interesting thing is that this lower bound is proportional to $N^{5/3}$ where $N$ is the number of fermions. If the particles were not fermions, the proportionality would have been $N$, which we can see by using the previous bound for 1 atom and multiplying by the number of atoms. So it is really the Pauli exclusion principle that contributes the factor $N^{2/3}$.</p>\\n\\n<p>Lieb goes then to show that this factor is crucial. He uses Thomas-Fermi theory as a relevant approximation of the behaviour of bulk matter to demonstrate this. This is were the analysis becomes very intricate. I have no time to summarize it in more detail. So I\\'ll just say that some theorems about the nature of TF theory are derived, these are then combined in the end to show that the minimum energy or ground state energy of the system is bounded from below. A numerical value for this bound is derived which is −23\\u202fRy/particle, (1\\u202fRy\\xa0≈\\xa013.6\\u202feV).</p>\\n\\n<p>The important take-away message is though that Fermi statistics or the Pauli exclusion principle is indeed essential to explain the stability of bulk matter.</p>\\n\\n<p>In Lieb\\'s paper, there is an extra chapter which tackles the question of why matter doesn\\'t explode, instead of implode. The interesting thing is that pure EM is sufficient to answer this question.</p>\\n',\n",

But there is one important distinction between the force due to the Higgs exchange and the usual fundamental interactions. The strong and electroweak interactions are described as gauge interactions. It means that they are not put by hand but arise automatically when you require that the matter fields be invariant under local certain internal transformations (phase rotations, color transformations, etc.). In contrast to that, the \"Higgs force\" is put into the model by hand, as its presence is not driven by any symmetry consideration.

       "  'Body': '<p>First, you are right in that non-Minkowski solutions to string theory, in which the gravitational field is macroscopic, it should be thought of as a condensate of a huge number of gravitons (which are one of the spacetime particles associated to a degree of freedom of the string).  (Aside:  a point particle, corresponding to quantum field theory, has no internal degrees of freedom; the different particles come simply from different labels attached to ponits.  A string has many degrees of freedom, each of which corresponds to a particle in the spacetime interpretation of string theory, i.e. the effective field theory.)</p>\\n\\n<p>To your question (1):  certainly there is no great organizing principle of string theory (yet).  One practical principle is that the 2-dimensional (quantum) field theory which describes the fluctuations of the string worldsheet should be <em>conformal</em>, i.e. independent of local scale invariance of the metric.  This allows us to integrate over all metrics on Riemann surfaces <em>only up to diffeomorphisms and scalings</em>, which is to say only up to a finite number of degrees of freedom.  That\\'s an integral we can do.  (Were we able to integrate over all metrics in a way that is sensible within quantum field theory, we would already have been able to quantize gravity.)  Now, scale invariance imposes constraints on the background spacetime fields used to construct the 2d action (such as the metric, which determines the energy of the map from the worldsheet of the string).  These constraints reduce to Einstein\\'s equations.  </p>\\n\\n<p>That\\'s not a very fundamental derivation, but formulating string theory in a way which is independent of the starting point (\"background independence\") is notoriously tricky.</p>\\n\\n<p>(2):  This goes under the name \"strings in background fields,\" and can be found in Volume 1 of Green, Schwarz and Witten.</p>\\n',\n",
